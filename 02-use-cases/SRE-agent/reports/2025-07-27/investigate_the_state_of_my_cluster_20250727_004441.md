# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** investigate the state of my cluster
**Status:** Investigation Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod complete failure due to missing ConfigMap key (`config/database.conf`) and persistent volume mount failures, compounded by cluster memory pressure (Node-3 at 85% memory usage)
- **Impact**: Service outage - Database service completely down in CrashLoopBackOff state; Performance degradation - Web application returning 503 errors and failing readiness probes
- **Severity**: **Critical** - Complete database failure with cascading application failures (15 container restart attempts, 10 volume mount failures)

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Restore missing `config/database.conf` key in ConfigMap `production/database-config` and verify persistent volume connectivity to recover database service
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Address memory pressure on Node-3 (85% usage) causing pod scheduling failures and investigate web application 503 errors
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Review resource allocation strategy and implement horizontal pod autoscaling to prevent future resource constraints
4. **Follow-up**: Monitor database recovery and application health metrics; review PostgreSQL data directory permissions

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- **Database service completely offline** - 15 restart failures blocking all database-dependent operations
- **Pod scheduling blocked** - Memory constraints preventing new workload deployment across cluster
- **Web application degraded** - 503 status codes indicating service instability affecting user experience

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- ## Cluster State Investigation Summary

Based on my comprehensive investigation of your Kubernetes cluster (production namespace), here's the current state:

### 🚨 **Critical Issues**

**1. Database Pod Complete Failure**
- According to get_pod_status tool: Pod `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q` is in "CrashLoopBackOff" status with 0% resource utilization
- Based on get_cluster_events data: Multiple cascading failures:
  - ConfigMap error: "couldn't find key config/database.conf in ConfigMap production/database-config" (15 occurrences)
  - Volume mount failure: "Unable to attach or mount volumes: unmounted volumes=[data], unattached volumes=[data]" (10 occurrences)
  - Container restart backoff: "Back-off restarting failed container" (15 occurrences)
  - PreStopHook failures: PostgreSQL shutdown commands failing (12 occurrences)

**2. Resource Constraints Causing Scheduling Issues**
- Per get_cluster_events output: Pod scheduling failures with "0/3 nodes are available: 3 Insufficient memory" (5 occurrences)
- According to get_node_status tool: Node-3 experiencing memory pressure with "Node memory usage is above 85%"
- Based on get_resource_usage data: Production namespace consuming 10Gi total memory

### ⚠️ **Warning Conditions**

**3. Application Health Degradation**
- According to get_cluster_events tool: Web app readiness probe failures with "HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 503" (3 occurrences)
- Per get_pod_status results: Web app pod showing high resource stress (75% CPU, 85% memory utilization)

### ✅ **Healthy Components**

**4. Node Infrastructure Status**
- Based on get_node_status tool: All 3 nodes report "Ready" status
- Per get_node_status data: Node resource distribution:
  - Node-1 (master/worker): 6Gi/7Gi memory (86% used), 45 pods
  - Node-2 (worker): 2Gi/7Gi memory (29% used), 20 pods
  - Node-3 (worker): 5Gi/7Gi memory (71% used), 60 pods
- According to get_node_status output: No disk pressure issues detected across cluster

**5. Supporting Services**
- Per get_pod_status tool: API service and both product catalog service replicas are running normally
- Based on get_pod_status data: Healthy resource utilization patterns on supporting workloads

### 🔧 **Immediate Action Plan**

**Priority 1 - Database Recovery:**
1. Verify and restore missing `config/database.conf` key in ConfigMap `production/database-config`
2. Investigate persistent volume claims and storage class connectivity
3. Check PostgreSQL data directory permissions and initialization

**Priority 2 - Resource Management:**
1. Address memory pressure on node-3 to resolve scheduling constraints
2. Consider horizontal pod autoscaling adjustments or node capacity expansion
3. Review resource requests/limits for memory-intensive workloads

**Priority 3 - Application Health:**
1. Investigate web application 503 errors affecting readiness probes
2. Monitor application performance under current resource constraints

The cluster infrastructure is fundamentally healthy, but critical application services are failing due to configuration and resource allocation issues requiring immediate intervention.

## ✅ Investigation Complete

All planned investigation steps have been executed.
