# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** API response times have degraded 3x in the last hour
**Status:** Investigation Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database service failure due to missing ConfigMap 'database-config' and invalid data directory permissions, causing cascading failures across dependent services
- **Impact**: Service instability with severe performance degradation - API response times increased 33x (150ms → 5000ms) with 75% error rates and memory exhaustion leading to web-service shutdown
- **Severity**: **Critical** - Complete database unavailability, web-service terminated, and authentication systems non-functional

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Restore database ConfigMap 'database-config' in production namespace and fix data directory permissions at '/var/lib/postgresql/data'
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Restart web-service pods after database recovery, investigate UserService.loadAllUsers method causing heap exhaustion, and review database connection pool timeout settings
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascade failures, scale web-service resources to handle memory demands, and optimize slow queries (currently 1250ms+)
4. **Follow-up**: Monitor database connectivity patterns and establish alerts for ConfigMap availability and memory utilization thresholds

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- **Database service**: 100% error rate with complete unavailability for 120+ seconds
- **Web-service shutdown**: Application terminated due to OutOfMemoryError in UserService component
- **Authentication failure**: User verification systems non-functional without database connectivity
- **Resource exhaustion**: Memory at 100% utilization (1024MB) and CPU at 95% on web-service

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Performance Metrics Agent
- ## Performance Metrics Analysis Summary

Based on my investigation, I've identified a **critical performance degradation** affecting your API response times. Here are the key findings:

### **Response Time Degradation (source: get_performance_metrics)**
- **web-service /api/users endpoint**: Response times increased from 150ms to 5000ms over 4 minutes
- **Degradation factor**: 33x increase (150ms → 5000ms), which significantly exceeds your reported 3x degradation
- **Timeline**: Degradation started at 14:21:00Z and rapidly escalated
- **Sample count decline**: Requests dropped from 100 to 20 samples, indicating service degradation

### **Trend Analysis (source: analyze_trends)**
- **Trend**: analyze_trends tool indicates: increasing response times with average value of 2500ms
- **Standard deviation**: 1200ms indicating high variability
- **Anomalies detected**: Two significant spikes at 14:23:00Z (3500ms, 40% deviation) and 14:24:00Z (5000ms, 100% deviation)

### **Error Rate Correlation (source: get_error_rates)**
- **web-service error rates**: Escalated from 0.5% to 75% during the same timeframe
- **Error pattern**: Predominantly server errors (500: 120, 503: 28 at 14:24:00Z)
- **Request volume**: Dropped from 1000 to 200 requests as performance degraded
- **Server errors**: Increased from 5 to 148 errors in the final measurement

### **Resource Utilization Critical Issues (source: get_resource_metrics)**
- **CPU usage**: get_resource_metrics data shows escalation from 25% to 95% on web-service
- **Memory usage**: get_resource_metrics data shows memory reached 100% utilization (1024MB) at 14:24:00Z
- **Resource exhaustion**: Both CPU and memory are at critical levels, indicating resource starvation

### **Root Cause Analysis**
The primary issue appears to be **database connectivity problems** (source: get_error_rates):
- **database service**: 100% error rate with "ConfigMap not found" and "Permission denied on data directory" failures
- **Connection refused errors**: 1440+ connection attempts failing consistently
- **Pod affected**: database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q experiencing startup failures

### **Service Health Comparison**
According to get_performance_metrics data, the **product-catalog-service** remains healthy:
- **Response times**: Stable at 20-25ms for /products/search
- **Error rates**: Minimal (0.006-0.02%) per get_error_rates data
- **Request volume**: Consistent 15000-17200 requests

### **Immediate Recommendations**
1. **Database Recovery**: Address the database ConfigMap and permission issues immediately
2. **Resource Scaling**: Scale up web-service resources (CPU/Memory) or restart pods to clear potential memory leaks
3. **Circuit Breaker**: Implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascade failures
4. **Load Balancing**: Redistribute traffic if possible while database issues are resolved
5. **Memory Investigation**: The 100% memory utilization suggests a memory leak or inefficient resource usage

The issue is isolated to services dependent on the failing database, while other services remain operational.

### Application Logs Agent
- ## Log Analysis Summary

Based on my analysis of the application logs, I've identified the root causes of the 3x API response time degradation:

### **Primary Issues Identified**

#### **1. Database Connectivity Failures (source: get_error_logs)**
- **Configuration Issues**: Error log from get_error_logs: 'FATAL: could not open configuration file '/etc/postgresql/database.conf': No such file or directory' at 2024-01-15T14:22:30.123Z
- **Permission Problems**: Error log from get_error_logs: 'FATAL: data directory '/var/lib/postgresql/data' has invalid permissions' at 2024-01-15T14:23:00.789Z  
- **Missing ConfigMap**: Error log from get_error_logs: 'ERROR: ConfigMap 'database-config' not found in namespace 'production'' at 2024-01-15T14:23:30.012Z

#### **2. Connection Timeout Pattern (source: analyze_log_patterns)**
- **Pattern**: analyze_log_patterns tool identified: "Database connection timeout" occurring 15 times between 14:23:46.567Z and 14:24:30.789Z
- **Specific Error**: Log entry from 2024-01-15T14:23:46.567Z (source: get_error_logs): 'Database connection timeout after 5000ms'
- **Impact**: Affecting /api/users endpoints with correlation IDs req-123456, req-123457

#### **3. Memory Exhaustion (source: analyze_log_patterns)**
- **Critical Pattern**: analyze_log_patterns tool identified: "OutOfMemoryError" occurring 8 times starting at 14:24:30.789Z
- **Heap Space Issue**: Error log from get_error_logs: 'java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space at com.example.UserService.loadAllUsers(UserService.java:45)' at 2024-01-15T14:24:30.789Z
- **Application Shutdown**: From get_recent_logs for service web-service: 'Application shutting down due to critical error' at 2024-01-15T14:25:11.456Z

#### **4. Slow Query Performance (source: analyze_log_patterns)**
- **Query Degradation**: analyze_log_patterns tool identified: "Slow query detected" pattern with 25 occurrences
- **Example**: Log entry showing 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE status='active' - Duration: 1250ms' at 2024-01-15T14:22:15.789Z

### **Service State Analysis (source: get_recent_logs)**
According to get_recent_logs tool results for web-service:
- **Database Unavailable**: 'Database has been unavailable for 120 seconds' at 2024-01-15T14:24:00.999Z
- **Fallback Mode**: 'Switching to cache-only mode due to database unavailability' at 2024-01-15T14:23:00.777Z
- **Authentication Impact**: 'User authentication failed: Cannot verify credentials without database' at 2024-01-15T14:23:00.888Z

### **Timeline of Events**
1. **14:22:15Z**: Slow queries begin appearing (1250ms duration)
2. **14:22:30Z**: Database configuration file missing
3. **14:23:00Z**: Database permission errors and health check failures
4. **14:23:46Z**: Connection timeouts start (5000ms timeout threshold)
5. **14:24:30Z**: OutOfMemoryError begins occurring
6. **14:25:11Z**: Web service shuts down due to critical errors

### **Immediate Actions Required**
1. **Database Recovery**: Fix the missing ConfigMap 'database-config' and resolve data directory permissions
2. **Memory Investigation**: The UserService.loadAllUsers method is causing heap exhaustion - investigate bulk operations
3. **Connection Pool**: Review database connection pool settings (currently timing out at 5000ms)
4. **Service Restart**: web-service has terminated and needs restart after database issues are resolved

The logs clearly show a cascading failure starting with database configuration issues, leading to connection timeouts, memory exhaustion, and ultimately service shutdown.
