# üîç Investigation Results

**Query:** API response times have degraded 3x in the last hour
**Status:** Investigation Complete

## üìã Executive Summary

### üéØ Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database service complete failure due to missing ConfigMap 'database-config' and invalid file permissions on data directory
- **Impact**: Service outage - web-service terminated at 14:25:14Z after experiencing 33x response time increase (150ms to 5000ms) and memory exhaustion
- **Severity**: **Critical** - Complete service failure with database unavailable and web-service terminated due to OutOfMemoryError

### ‚ö° Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Restore missing ConfigMap 'database-config' and fix data directory permissions on database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Restart database service, increase web-service memory allocation beyond 1024MB, and restart terminated web-service
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement circuit breaker patterns, horizontal scaling for web-service, and configuration validation checks
4. **Follow-up**: Monitor database health checks and implement alerts for ConfigMap availability

### üö® Critical Alerts
- **Database service**: 100% error rate with complete unavailability since 14:22:30Z
- **Web-service**: Application terminated due to OutOfMemoryError - requires immediate restart
- **API authentication**: Completely non-functional due to database dependency failure
- **Error rates**: Escalated from 0.5% to 75% before service termination

## üéØ Key Findings

### Performance Metrics Agent
- ## Performance Metrics Analysis Summary

Based on my investigation, I've identified a **critical performance degradation** affecting your API response times. Here are the key findings:

### **Response Time Degradation (source: get_performance_metrics)**
- **web-service /api/users endpoint**: Response times increased from 150ms to 5000ms over 4 minutes
- **Degradation factor**: 33x increase (significantly worse than the reported 3x)
- **Timeline**: Started at 14:21:00Z, peaked at 14:24:00Z
- **Sample count drop**: From 100 requests/minute to 20 requests/minute, indicating service degradation

### **Trend Analysis (source: analyze_trends)**
- **Trend**: Increasing response times with average of 2500ms (source: analyze_trends)
- **Standard deviation**: 1200ms indicating high variability (source: analyze_trends)
- **Anomalies detected**: Two significant spikes at 14:23:00Z (3500ms, 40% deviation) and 14:24:00Z (5000ms, 100% deviation) (source: analyze_trends)

### **Error Rate Correlation (source: get_error_rates)**
- **web-service error rates**: Escalated from 0.5% to 75% during the same timeframe
- **Error pattern**: Predominantly 500 (server errors) and 503 (service unavailable) responses
- **Request volume**: Dropped from 1000 to 200 requests/minute, indicating service degradation

### **Root Cause Analysis**

**Primary Issue - Database Failure (source: get_error_rates)**:
- **database service**: 100% error rate with "ConfigMap not found" and "Permission denied on data directory" failures
- **Pod**: database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q is completely unavailable
- **Connection refused**: 1440+ connection refused errors

**Secondary Issue - Resource Exhaustion (source: get_resource_metrics)**:
- **CPU utilization**: Increased from 25% to 95% on web-service (source: get_resource_metrics)
- **Memory utilization**: Reached 100% (1024MB) at peak degradation time (source: get_resource_metrics)

### **Service Health Comparison**
The **product-catalog-service remains healthy** with consistent performance (source: get_performance_metrics):
- Response times: 20-25ms (stable)
- Error rates: 0.006-0.02% (minimal)
- Request volume: 15,000-17,200 requests/minute (increasing)

### **Immediate Recommendations**

1. **Database Recovery**: Address the database pod configuration and permission issues immediately
2. **Resource Scaling**: Scale up web-service resources or implement horizontal scaling
3. **Circuit Breaker**: Implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascade failures
4. **Load Balancing**: Consider redirecting traffic to healthy services while web-service recovers

The issue is isolated to the web-service and its database dependency, with the database failure being the primary root cause triggering the cascade of performance issues.

### Application Logs Agent
- ## Log Analysis Summary

Based on my analysis of the application logs, I've identified the root causes of the 3x API response time degradation:

### **Primary Issue - Database Failure (source: get_error_logs)**
The database service is completely unavailable due to configuration issues:
- **14:22:30.123Z**: "FATAL: could not open configuration file '/etc/postgresql/database.conf': No such file or directory" (source: get_error_logs)
- **14:23:00.789Z**: "FATAL: data directory '/var/lib/postgresql/data' has invalid permissions" (source: get_error_logs)  
- **14:23:30.012Z**: "ERROR: ConfigMap 'database-config' not found in namespace 'production'" (source: get_error_logs)
- **14:24:30.345Z**: "Container postgres failed liveness probe, will be restarted" (source: get_error_logs)

### **Secondary Issue - Memory Exhaustion (source: get_error_logs and get_recent_logs)**
The web-service experienced critical memory issues:
- **14:24:30.789Z**: "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space" at UserService.loadAllUsers() (source: get_error_logs)
- **14:25:11.456Z**: "Application shutting down due to critical error" with shutdown reason OutOfMemoryError (source: get_error_logs)
- **14:25:14.456Z**: "Application terminated" (source: get_recent_logs)

### **Recurring Patterns (source: analyze_log_patterns)**
- **Database connection timeouts**: 15 occurrences between 14:23:46Z - 14:24:30Z
- **OutOfMemoryError**: 8 critical occurrences starting at 14:24:30Z
- **Slow query detected**: 25 warnings with queries taking >1250ms

### **Service Response Timeline (source: get_recent_logs)**
1. **14:23:00Z**: Database health check failures began
2. **14:23:00Z**: Web-service switched to "cache-only mode due to database unavailability"
3. **14:24:00Z**: "Database has been unavailable for 120 seconds"
4. **14:25:11Z**: Application initiated graceful shutdown due to OutOfMemoryError

### **Impact Assessment**
- **API authentication failures**: "Cannot verify credentials without database" (source: get_recent_logs)
- **Service degradation**: Web-service operating in degraded cache-only mode
- **Complete service outage**: Application terminated at 14:25:14Z

### **Immediate Actions Required**
1. **Fix database configuration**: Restore missing ConfigMap 'database-config' and fix file permissions
2. **Restart database pod**: Address the configuration and permission issues on database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q
3. **Increase memory allocation**: The web-service needs more heap space to handle current load
4. **Restart web-service**: Application has terminated and needs to be restarted

The logs clearly show a cascade failure starting with database configuration issues, leading to connection timeouts, memory exhaustion, and ultimately complete service failure.
