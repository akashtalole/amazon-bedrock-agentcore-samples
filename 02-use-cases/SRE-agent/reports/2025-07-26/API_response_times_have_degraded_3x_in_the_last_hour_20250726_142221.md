# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** API response times have degraded 3x in the last hour
**Status:** Investigation Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database service complete failure due to missing ConfigMap 'database-config' and invalid data directory permissions, causing cascading system failures
- **Impact**: Service outage - API response times degraded from 150ms to 5,000ms (33x increase), followed by complete application termination due to OutOfMemoryError
- **Severity**: **Critical** - Complete service failure with database down, web service crashed, and application terminated

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Restore database service by fixing ConfigMap 'database-config' in production namespace and correcting data directory permissions for `/var/lib/postgresql/data`
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Restart crashed web service application and scale resources (CPU at 95%, memory at 100% before crash)
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement circuit breaker patterns, tune database connection pool settings, and increase memory limits for UserService component
4. **Follow-up**: Review database configuration management and add monitoring for ConfigMap availability

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- **Database service completely down** - 100% error rate with configuration failures
- **Web service application terminated** - OutOfMemoryError in UserService.loadAllUsers() at 14:24:30
- **API completely non-responsive** - Service degraded from 3x to 33x slower before complete failure
- **Resource exhaustion** - CPU and memory utilization reached 100% before crash

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Performance Metrics Agent
- ## Performance Metrics Analysis Summary

Based on the performance metrics data, I've identified a **critical performance degradation** affecting your API response times. Here's what the data shows:

### **Response Time Degradation (source: get_performance_metrics)**
- **14:20**: 150ms average response time (baseline)
- **14:21**: 1,200ms (8x increase from baseline)
- **14:22**: 2,500ms (17x increase from baseline)
- **14:23**: 3,500ms (23x increase from baseline)
- **14:24**: 5,000ms (33x increase from baseline)

According to analyze_trends tool: The trend is **increasing** with an average value of 2,500ms and significant anomalies detected at 14:23 (40% deviation) and 14:24 (100% deviation).

### **Root Cause Analysis**

**1. Database Service Complete Failure (source: get_error_rates)**
- Database service shows 100% error rate with "ConfigMap not found" and "Permission denied on data directory" failures (source: get_error_rates)
- This is the primary cause of the cascading performance issues

**2. Resource Exhaustion (source: get_resource_metrics)**
- **CPU utilization**: Escalated from 25% to 95% (source: get_resource_metrics)
- **Memory usage**: Increased from 50% to 100% (source: get_resource_metrics)
- The web-service is hitting resource limits, causing performance degradation

**3. Error Rate Correlation (source: get_error_rates)**
- Web-service error rates increased dramatically:
  - 14:20: 0.5% error rate
  - 14:24: 75% error rate
- Server errors (500/503) dominate, indicating backend issues

**4. Request Volume Impact (source: get_performance_metrics)**
- Sample count dropped from 100 to 20 requests, indicating service degradation
- 15 errors recorded in the final measurement period

### **Service Comparison (source: get_performance_metrics)**
- **Product-catalog-service** remains healthy: 20-25ms response times, <0.02% error rate
- **Web-service** is severely impacted by database dependency failure

### **Immediate Recommendations**

1. **Fix Database Service**: Address the ConfigMap and permission issues preventing database startup
2. **Scale Web-Service**: CPU and memory are at 100% utilization - immediate scaling needed
3. **Circuit Breaker**: Implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascade failures
4. **Database Connection Pool**: Review connection timeout and pool size configurations

The 3x degradation you mentioned is actually much worse - we're seeing up to **33x degradation** in the worst case, with the situation rapidly deteriorating due to database service failure and resource exhaustion.

### Application Logs Agent
- ## Log Analysis Summary

Based on my analysis of the application logs, I've identified the root causes of your API response time degradation:

### **Primary Issues Identified**

**1. Database Service Complete Failure (source: get_error_logs)**
- **14:22:30**: Database configuration file missing: `FATAL: could not open configuration file '/etc/postgresql/database.conf': No such file or directory` (source: get_error_logs)
- **14:23:00**: Permission issues: `FATAL: data directory '/var/lib/postgresql/data' has invalid permissions` (source: get_error_logs)  
- **14:23:30**: ConfigMap missing: `ERROR: ConfigMap 'database-config' not found in namespace 'production'` (source: get_error_logs)
- **14:24:30**: Liveness probe failures: `Container postgres failed liveness probe, will be restarted` (source: get_error_logs)

**2. Cascading Connection Timeouts (source: analyze_log_patterns)**
- **Pattern identified**: "Database connection timeout" occurred **15 times** between 14:23:46 and 14:24:30 (source: analyze_log_patterns)
- Log entry from get_error_logs: `Database connection timeout after 5000ms` at 14:23:46.567Z
- Connection pool exhaustion: `Database connection pool exhausted, waiting for available connection` at 14:23:45.234Z (source: get_recent_logs)

**3. Memory Exhaustion Leading to Application Crash (source: analyze_log_patterns)**
- **Pattern identified**: "OutOfMemoryError" occurred **8 times** starting at 14:24:30 (source: analyze_log_patterns)
- Critical error from get_error_logs: `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space at com.example.UserService.loadAllUsers(UserService.java:45)` at 14:24:30.789Z
- Application shutdown: `Application shutting down due to critical error` at 14:25:11.456Z (source: get_error_logs)

**4. Performance Degradation Timeline (source: get_recent_logs)**
- **14:21:00**: Normal operation - `Request completed in 333ms - Status: 200`
- **14:22:15**: First performance warning - `Slow query detected: SELECT * FROM users WHERE status='active' - Duration: 1250ms`
- **14:23:00**: Database unavailability - `Switching to cache-only mode due to database unavailability`
- **14:24:00**: Circuit breaker activation - `Circuit breaker activated for database service`
- **14:25:14**: Complete service failure - `Application terminated`

### **Slow Query Pattern (source: analyze_log_patterns)**
According to analyze_log_patterns tool: "Slow query detected" pattern occurred **25 times** between 14:22:15 and 14:23:45, indicating database performance issues before complete failure.

### **Immediate Action Required**

1. **Fix Database Pod**: Address ConfigMap and permission issues for `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q`
2. **Restart Web Service**: Application has terminated due to OutOfMemoryError
3. **Increase Memory Limits**: Logs show memory exhaustion in UserService.loadAllUsers()
4. **Database Connection Pool Tuning**: Connection timeouts suggest pool configuration issues

The logs confirm your 3x response time degradation escalated to complete service failure due to database configuration issues and subsequent memory exhaustion.
