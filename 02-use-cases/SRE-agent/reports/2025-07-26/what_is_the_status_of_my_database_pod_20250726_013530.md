# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** what is the status of my database pod
**Status:** Investigation Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Missing ConfigMap "database-config" in production namespace - specifically the required key "config/database.conf" (15 occurrences of this error)
- **Impact**: Complete database service outage - database pod in CrashLoopBackOff state with 0% availability
- **Severity**: Critical - database pod has been down for approximately 5 hours with 15 restart attempts, causing dependent services to return 503 errors

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Create or restore the missing ConfigMap "database-config" with the required "config/database.conf" key
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Address the data directory permission issues ("Permission denied on data directory" errors)
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement ConfigMap validation in CI/CD pipeline to prevent similar configuration errors
4. **Follow-up**: Review database pod shutdown procedures (PreStopHook failures indicate improper shutdown)

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- All database-dependent endpoints returning 503 Service Unavailable
- User authentication failing due to database unavailability
- Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) has been down since 2024-01-15T09:15:00Z (5 hours)

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- Based on my investigation, I can provide you with the status of your database pod:

## Database Pod Status

According to the `get_pod_status` tool output, I found a database pod named **database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q** in the production namespace. This pod is currently in a **CrashLoopBackOff** state (source: get_pod_status).

### Details:
- **Pod Name**: database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q
- **Namespace**: production
- **Status**: CrashLoopBackOff
- **Phase**: Failed
- **Node**: node-2
- **Created at**: 2024-01-15T09:15:00Z
- **Resource Usage**: CPU: 0, Memory: 0 (0% utilization for both)

### Related Issues:
Based on `get_cluster_events` data, there are two critical errors affecting this pod:

1. **Configuration Error**: "Error: couldn't find key config/database.conf in ConfigMap production/database-config" (15 occurrences)
2. **Shutdown Error**: "PreStopHook failed: exec [/bin/sh -c pg_ctl stop -D /var/lib/postgresql/data -m fast] failed: exit status 1" (12 occurrences)

### Recommendation:
The pod is failing because it cannot find a required configuration file. You should check that:
1. The ConfigMap "database-config" exists in the production namespace
2. The ConfigMap contains the required key "config/database.conf"

### Application Logs Agent
- ## Database Pod Status Report

Based on my analysis of the application logs, I can provide the following information about your database pod:

### Current Status: Not Operational

According to search_logs tool results, your database pod (identified as `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q`) is currently **not responding** and appears to be down. This is evidenced by multiple error logs from dependent services.

### Key Findings:

1. **Connection Failures**: Multiple services are reporting database connection failures:
   - Log entry from 2024-01-15T14:22:00.111Z (source: search_logs): "Failed to connect to database: Connection refused (Connection refused)"
   - Log entry from 2024-01-15T14:22:00.222Z (source: search_logs): "Database pod database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q is not responding"

2. **Health Check Failures**: 
   - Log entry from 2024-01-15T14:23:00.666Z (source: search_logs): "Database health check failed: no response from database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q"

3. **Service Impact**:
   - Log entry from 2024-01-15T14:25:00.222Z (source: search_logs): "All database-dependent endpoints returning 503 Service Unavailable"
   - Log entry from 2024-01-15T14:23:00.888Z (source: search_logs): "User authentication failed: Cannot verify credentials without database"

4. **Pattern Analysis**: 
   - analyze_log_patterns tool identified: "Database connection timeout" pattern occurring 15 times between 14:23:46 and 14:24:30

### No Direct Database Logs Available:
I attempted to retrieve logs directly from the database service, but no logs were available (source: get_recent_logs and get_error_logs). This could indicate that:
- The database pod is completely down and not generating logs
- The database pod's logs are not being properly collected
- The database service might be using a different service name in the logging system

### Recommendation:
Based on the application logs analysis, I recommend:
1. Check if the database pod is running using Kubernetes commands
2. Investigate potential configuration issues or resource constraints
3. Check for any recent changes that might have affected the database pod
4. Review the database pod's events for specific error messages

### Performance Metrics Agent
- ## Database Pod Status Report

Based on the metrics data I've gathered, I can provide you with the following assessment of your database pod:

### Current Status: CRITICAL - Not Available

According to the `get_availability_metrics` data, your database pod (identified as `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q`) is currently **down** with 0% availability. The pod has been down since 2024-01-15T09:15:00Z, which is approximately 5 hours of continuous downtime (source: get_availability_metrics).

### Key Metrics:
- **Availability**: 0% (source: get_availability_metrics)
- **Health Check Success Rate**: 0 out of 1442 checks (source: get_availability_metrics)
- **Error Rate**: 100% (source: get_error_rates)
- **Restart Count**: 15 (source: get_availability_metrics)

### Error Analysis:
According to `get_error_rates` data, the database pod is experiencing:
1. **Connection Refused Errors**: 1442 occurrences (as of 14:22:00Z)
2. **Startup Failures**: 15 occurrences
3. **Failure Reasons**: 
   - "ConfigMap not found" (14:20:00Z and 14:21:00Z)
   - "Permission denied on data directory" (14:22:00Z)

### Resource Metrics:
No CPU or memory metrics are available for the database pod, which is consistent with a pod that is not running properly (source: get_resource_metrics).

### Performance Impact:
The database service has been completely unavailable for approximately 5 hours (18,420 seconds), which is likely impacting any dependent services (source: get_availability_metrics).

### Recommendation:
Based on the metrics data, the database pod is failing to start due to configuration issues. The specific errors indicate:
1. Missing ConfigMap resource
2. Permission issues with the data directory

These are typical Kubernetes configuration issues that need to be addressed by:
1. Ensuring the required ConfigMap exists and is properly mounted
2. Checking the permissions on the database data directory
3. Reviewing the pod's configuration for any other issues

Would you like me to help you investigate any specific aspect of these metrics further?

## ✅ Investigation Complete

All planned investigation steps have been executed.
