# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infrastructure
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) in CrashLoopBackOff state, indicating repeated startup failures
- **Impact**: Service instability - database service unavailable while application services remain operational
- **Severity**: **High** - Database failure can cascade to dependent services and affect data operations

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Investigate database pod logs to identify crash cause and attempt manual restart
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Resolve database startup issues and verify data integrity after recovery
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement database health monitoring and automated failover mechanisms
4. **Follow-up**: Review resource allocation for web-app-deployment pod showing high memory utilization (85%)

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- **Database service completely unavailable** - CrashLoopBackOff indicates persistent startup failures requiring immediate intervention
- **High memory pressure** on web-app-deployment pod (85% utilization) may lead to performance degradation

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- Based on the get_pod_status tool results, here are the pods currently running in your production namespace:

## Production Namespace Pods

**Running Pods:**
1. **web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p**
   - Status: Running
   - Node: node-1
   - CPU: 250m (75% utilization)
   - Memory: 512Mi (85% utilization)
   - Created: 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z

2. **api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r**
   - Status: Running
   - Node: node-3
   - CPU: 150m (45% utilization)
   - Memory: 256Mi (60% utilization)
   - Created: 2024-01-15T08:00:00Z

3. **product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-h4k3m**
   - Status: Running
   - Node: node-1
   - CPU: 100m (25% utilization)
   - Memory: 256Mi (40% utilization)
   - Created: 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z

4. **product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-m8n2p**
   - Status: Running
   - Node: node-2
   - CPU: 95m (24% utilization)
   - Memory: 248Mi (39% utilization)
   - Created: 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z

**⚠️ Failed Pod:**
- **database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q**
  - Status: CrashLoopBackOff (Failed phase)
  - Node: node-2
  - CPU/Memory: 0 (pod not running)
  - Created: 2024-01-15T09:15:00Z

**Summary:** According to get_pod_status tool data, you have 5 total pods in production - 4 running successfully and 1 in CrashLoopBackOff state that requires attention.

If you need to check pods in other namespaces (like kube-system, default, etc.), please let me know the specific namespace name.

## 📋 Next Steps

3. Provide organized summary of all pods in the infrastructure
