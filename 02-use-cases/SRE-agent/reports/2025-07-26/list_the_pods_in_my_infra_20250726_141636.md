# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) is in CrashLoopBackOff state, indicating repeated failures to start successfully
- **Impact**: Potential service instability for applications dependent on the database
- **Severity**: High - Database service is failing to start while web and API services remain operational

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Check database pod logs to identify specific failure reason
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Resolve database pod startup issues and verify application connectivity
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement monitoring alerts for pod status and resource utilization
4. **Follow-up**: Review high memory utilization (85%) on web-app-deployment pod

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Database service is repeatedly crashing, potentially affecting data availability for dependent services

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- ## Pods in Production Namespace

Based on the get_pod_status tool results, here are the pods currently in your production namespace:

1. **web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p**
   - Status: Running
   - Node: node-1
   - Created: 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z
   - Resource Usage: CPU: 250m (75% utilization), Memory: 512Mi (85% utilization)

2. **database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q**
   - Status: CrashLoopBackOff
   - Node: node-2
   - Created: 2024-01-15T09:15:00Z
   - Resource Usage: CPU: 0 (0% utilization), Memory: 0 (0% utilization)

3. **api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r**
   - Status: Running
   - Node: node-3
   - Created: 2024-01-15T08:00:00Z
   - Resource Usage: CPU: 150m (45% utilization), Memory: 256Mi (60% utilization)

4. **product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-h4k3m**
   - Status: Running
   - Node: node-1
   - Created: 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z
   - Resource Usage: CPU: 100m (25% utilization), Memory: 256Mi (40% utilization)

5. **product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-m8n2p**
   - Status: Running
   - Node: node-2
   - Created: 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z
   - Resource Usage: CPU: 95m (24% utilization), Memory: 248Mi (39% utilization)

Note: I see that the database-pod is in CrashLoopBackOff state, which indicates it's having issues. If you'd like to investigate this further or check pods in a different namespace, please let me know.

## 📋 Next Steps

3. Provide a summary of pod count by namespace and status
