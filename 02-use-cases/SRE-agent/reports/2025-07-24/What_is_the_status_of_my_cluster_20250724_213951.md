# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** What is the status of my cluster?
**Status:** Investigation Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Investigation system failure - Kubernetes monitoring tools are non-functional due to technical configuration issues
- **Impact**: **Monitoring blindness** - Unable to assess actual cluster health status
- **Severity**: **High** - Complete loss of observability into cluster state creates operational risk

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Restore monitoring capabilities by fixing tool configuration issues in the investigation system
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Manually verify cluster status using direct kubectl commands or alternative monitoring tools
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement backup monitoring systems and validate investigation tool reliability
4. **Follow-up**: Test investigation system functionality before next incident response

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- **Monitoring System Down**: Primary cluster investigation tools are failing - manual verification of cluster health required immediately
- **Operational Risk**: Cannot determine if cluster issues exist due to investigation system failure

**Note**: This summary reflects the investigation system failure only. The actual cluster status remains unknown and requires immediate manual assessment through alternative means.

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- Agent execution failed: Found AIMessages with tool_calls that do not have a corresponding ToolMessage. Here are the first few of those tool calls: [{'name': 'k8s-api___get_cluster_events', 'args': {'severity': 'Warning'}, 'id': 'toolu_011AazHVidg4hjfMuJSmenPU', 'type': 'tool_call'}, {'name': 'k8s-api___get_node_status', 'args': {}, 'id': 'toolu_01JAvDqmRJxAc5SJnYzimoJJ', 'type': 'tool_call'}].

Every tool call (LLM requesting to call a tool) in the message history MUST have a corresponding ToolMessage (result of a tool invocation to return to the LLM) - this is required by most LLM providers.

## ✅ Investigation Complete

All planned investigation steps have been executed.
