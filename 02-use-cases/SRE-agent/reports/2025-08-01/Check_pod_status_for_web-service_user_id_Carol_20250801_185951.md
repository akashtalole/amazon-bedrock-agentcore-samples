# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** Check pod status for web-service

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: OutOfMemoryError causing web-service application termination, compounded by database connectivity failures (database-pod in CrashLoopBackOff state)
- **Impact**: Service outage - web-service application completely terminated at 14:25:14 UTC
- **Severity**: **Critical** - Complete service failure with cascading database infrastructure issues affecting user authentication and data operations

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Restart web-service with increased memory allocation and resolve database-pod CrashLoopBackOff to restore core services
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Implement memory monitoring alerts and database connection pooling optimization to prevent recurrence
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Conduct capacity planning review for heap sizing and database infrastructure resilience
4. **Follow-up**: Establish proactive monitoring for memory utilization trends and database dependency health checks

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- **Business Impact**: Complete service unavailability affecting user authentication and data access operations
- **Infrastructure Risk**: Database pod instability creating single point of failure for dependent services
- **Resource Constraint**: Memory exhaustion pattern indicates immediate scaling requirements

**Notification Channels**: #carol-executive, #strategic-alerts  
**Escalation**: Executive team contact after 20-minute threshold per defined parameters

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- According to the get_pod_status tool results, I do not see the exact pod 'web-service' in the production namespace. However, I found several pods that might be related to web services:

**Available pods in production namespace:**

1. **web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p**
   - Status: Running
   - Phase: Running
   - Node: node-1
   - Created: 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z
   - Resource Usage: CPU 250m (75% utilization), Memory 512Mi (85% utilization)

2. **api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r**
   - Status: Running
   - Phase: Running
   - Node: node-3
   - Created: 2024-01-15T08:00:00Z
   - Resource Usage: CPU 150m (45% utilization), Memory 256Mi (60% utilization)

3. **product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-h4k3m**
   - Status: Running
   - Phase: Running
   - Node: node-1
   - Created: 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z
   - Resource Usage: CPU 100m (25% utilization), Memory 256Mi (40% utilization)

4. **product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-m8n2p**
   - Status: Running
   - Phase: Running
   - Node: node-2
   - Created: 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z
   - Resource Usage: CPU 95m (24% utilization), Memory 248Mi (39% utilization)

**Issue Found:**
- **database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q** is in CrashLoopBackOff state, which could impact web services

The exact pod name 'web-service' was not found in the production namespace. If you're looking for a specific web service pod, it might have a different naming convention (like 'web-app-deployment' shown above) or be in a different namespace. You can specify a different namespace if needed.

### Application Logs Agent
- Based on my log analysis for web-service, I can provide insights into the application's status and issues:

## Critical Issues Identified

**According to get_recent_logs and get_error_logs data:**

### 1. Application Shutdown (Most Recent)
- **Status**: Application terminated at 2024-01-15T14:25:14.456Z
- **Root Cause**: OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space (source: get_recent_logs)
- **Shutdown Sequence**: Graceful shutdown was initiated due to critical error

### 2. Memory Issues
- **Error from get_error_logs**: "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space" at 2024-01-15T14:24:30.789Z
- **Impact**: Application unable to allocate memory for ArrayList operations
- **Affected Endpoint**: /api/users/bulk (correlation_id: req-123458)

### 3. Database Connectivity Problems
- **Critical Alert**: "Database has been unavailable for 120 seconds" at 2024-01-15T14:24:00.999Z (source: get_recent_logs)
- **Connection Errors**: Multiple database connection timeouts after 5000ms
- **Affected Operations**: User authentication and user data retrieval
- **Fallback Mode**: Application switched to cache-only mode

### 4. Service Dependencies
- **Database Pod Issue**: Health check failed for "database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q" (source: get_recent_logs)
- **User Impact**: Authentication failures due to database unavailability

## Application Status Summary
The web-service application has **terminated** due to critical OutOfMemoryError. Before shutdown, it was experiencing severe database connectivity issues and had switched to degraded cache-only mode.

For actual pod status and restart information, you should consult the Kubernetes Agent who can provide detailed pod health, resource utilization, and restart policies.

## ✅ Investigation Complete

All planned investigation steps have been executed.
