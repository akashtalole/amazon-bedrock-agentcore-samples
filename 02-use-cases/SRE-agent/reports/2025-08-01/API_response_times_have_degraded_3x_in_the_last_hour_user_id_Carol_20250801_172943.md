# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** API response times have degraded 3x in the last hour

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database configuration failure - missing ConfigMap 'database-config' and invalid permissions on data directory '/var/lib/postgresql/data'
- **Impact**: Severe service degradation with 75% error rate and 33x response time increase (150ms to 5000ms)
- **Severity**: Critical - database service showing 100% error rate, web-service experiencing memory exhaustion and application shutdown

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Fix missing ConfigMap 'database-config' in production namespace and correct data directory permissions
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Implement shorter database connection timeouts and add circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Review connection pool settings and implement graceful degradation for database unavailability
4. **Follow-up**: Notify executive team via #carol-executive and #strategic-alerts channels with resolution confirmation

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Web-service application shutdown occurred at 14:25:11 due to OutOfMemoryError
- Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) requires immediate restart after configuration fixes
- Business impact: 75% of API requests failing, remaining requests experiencing 5-second response times

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Performance Metrics Agent
- ## Summary of API Response Time Degradation

Based on my analysis, I can confirm a severe API response time degradation in the `web-service` that has increased by more than 33x (not just 3x) in the past hour.

### Key Findings:

1. **Response Time Degradation**:
   - According to get_performance_metrics data, the `/api/users` endpoint response time increased from 150ms to 5000ms within 5 minutes (14:20 to 14:24)
   - The p95 response time increased from 200ms to 5000ms (source: get_performance_metrics)
   - The trend analysis confirms an increasing pattern with a 100% deviation percentage at 14:24 (source: analyze_trends)

2. **Resource Utilization Spike**:
   - CPU usage increased from 25% to 95% (source: get_resource_metrics)
   - Memory usage reached 100% (1024MB) at 14:24, up from 50% (512MB) at 14:20 (source: get_resource_metrics)

3. **Error Rate Explosion**:
   - Error rate jumped from 0.5% to 75% (source: get_error_rates)
   - Server errors (500, 503) increased dramatically from 5 to 148 (source: get_error_rates)
   - Total requests dropped from 1000 to 200, indicating service degradation (source: get_error_rates)

4. **Database Issues**:
   - The database service is showing 100% error rate with "ConfigMap not found" and "Permission denied on data directory" errors (source: get_error_rates)
   - These database failures correlate with the timing of the web-service degradation

### Root Cause Analysis:

The primary cause appears to be database connectivity issues. The web-service is likely experiencing timeouts while trying to connect to the failing database, causing:
1. Increased response times as connections wait to timeout
2. Resource exhaustion (memory and CPU) from connection pooling/retries
3. Cascading failures as resources are depleted

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate**:
   - Check the database ConfigMap and permissions on the data directory
   - Restart the database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q)
   - Consider scaling up web-service temporarily to handle the load

2. **Short-term**:
   - Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
   - Add connection timeout limits to prevent resource exhaustion
   - Review error handling for database connection failures

3. **Long-term**:
   - Implement graceful degradation patterns
   - Add automated alerts for response time increases over 2x baseline
   - Review database access patterns and connection pooling configuration

This appears to be a critical incident requiring immediate attention as the service is effectively down with a 75% error rate and 5000ms response times.

### Application Logs Agent
- ## API Response Time Degradation Analysis

Based on the log analysis, I've identified the root causes of the API response time degradation:

### Key Findings:

1. **Database Connection Failures**
   - According to get_error_logs output, the database service is experiencing critical failures starting at 14:22:30
   - Multiple database errors show configuration issues:
     - "FATAL: could not open configuration file '/etc/postgresql/database.conf': No such file or directory"
     - "ERROR: ConfigMap 'database-config' not found in namespace 'production'"
     - "FATAL: data directory '/var/lib/postgresql/data' has invalid permissions"

2. **Connection Timeouts Leading to Performance Degradation**
   - According to analyze_log_patterns tool, there are 15 "Database connection timeout" errors between 14:23:46 and 14:24:30
   - Web-service logs show "Database connection timeout after 5000ms" (source: get_error_logs)
   - Connection pool exhaustion warning: "Database connection pool exhausted, waiting for available connection" (source: search_logs)

3. **Memory Issues and Application Failure**
   - OutOfMemoryError occurred at 14:24:30 (source: get_error_logs)
   - The application eventually shut down at 14:25:11 due to critical errors (source: get_recent_logs)
   - 8 OutOfMemoryError occurrences were detected (source: analyze_log_patterns)

4. **Slow Query Performance**
   - 25 slow query warnings detected between 14:22:15 and 14:23:45 (source: analyze_log_patterns)
   - Example: "Slow query detected: SELECT * FROM users WHERE status='active' - Duration: 1250ms"

### Root Cause:

The primary issue is a database failure caused by missing configuration (ConfigMap) and permission problems. This led to:
1. Connection timeouts in the web-service
2. Connection pool exhaustion
3. Memory issues as connections accumulated
4. Eventually application failure

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Fix the missing ConfigMap 'database-config' in the production namespace
   - Correct permissions on the database data directory: '/var/lib/postgresql/data'
   - Restart the database pod: database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q
   - Restart the web-service after database is operational

2. **Short-term Fixes:**
   - Implement shorter database connection timeouts (current 5000ms is too long)
   - Add circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
   - Review connection pool settings to prevent exhaustion

3. **Long-term Improvements:**
   - Implement better graceful degradation when database is unavailable
   - Review and optimize the slow query: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE status='active'"
   - Add monitoring alerts for database configuration issues
   - Increase memory allocation for web-service to handle peak loads

The logs clearly show a cascading failure pattern starting with database configuration issues, leading to connection timeouts, and ultimately resulting in memory exhaustion and application failure.
