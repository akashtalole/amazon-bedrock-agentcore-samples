# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** API response times have degraded 3x in the last hour

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database configuration failure with missing ConfigMap 'database-config' in production namespace and invalid permissions on data directory
- **Impact**: Severe performance degradation with cascading failure - API response times increased from 150ms to 5000ms (33x slower)
- **Severity**: High - Database service showing 100% error rate, web-service experiencing memory exhaustion and 75% error rate

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Verify and restore the missing database ConfigMap 'database-config' in production namespace
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Fix permissions on '/var/lib/postgresql/data' directory and increase web-service heap memory allocation
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement circuit breakers and connection pooling improvements to prevent cascading failures
4. **Follow-up**: Notify #carol-executive and #strategic-alerts channels of resolution status

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Web-service experiencing OutOfMemoryErrors leading to application shutdowns
- Database connection pool exhausted with 5000ms timeouts
- User request volume dropped from 1000 to 200, indicating significant business impact

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Performance Metrics Agent
- ## Analysis of API Response Time Degradation

Based on the metrics data, I can confirm a severe API response time degradation in the last hour, with response times increasing by more than 33x (not just 3x).

### Key Findings:

1. **Response Time Degradation (web-service):**
   - According to get_performance_metrics data, the `/api/users` endpoint response time increased from 150ms to 5000ms within 5 minutes
   - P95 response times increased from 200ms to 5000ms (source: get_performance_metrics)
   - The trend analysis confirms an "increasing" trend with anomalies detected at 14:23 and 14:24 (source: analyze_trends)

2. **Resource Utilization Spike:**
   - CPU usage increased from 25% to 95% (source: get_resource_metrics)
   - Memory usage reached 100% (1024MB) from an initial 50% (512MB) (source: get_resource_metrics)
   - This indicates resource exhaustion is likely contributing to the degradation

3. **Error Rate Explosion:**
   - Error rate increased from 0.5% to 75% (source: get_error_rates)
   - Server errors (500, 503) increased dramatically from 5 to 148 (source: get_error_rates)
   - Request volume dropped from 1000 to 200, suggesting users are abandoning requests (source: get_error_rates)

4. **Database Issues:**
   - Database service is showing 100% error rate with "ConfigMap not found" and "Permission denied on data directory" errors (source: get_error_rates)
   - These database failures are likely the root cause of the web-service degradation

5. **Healthy Services:**
   - The product-catalog-service remains stable with fast response times (20-25ms) and minimal errors (source: get_performance_metrics, get_error_rates)

## Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate:**
   - Investigate the database ConfigMap issue - this appears to be the root cause
   - Check permissions on the database data directory
   - Consider rolling back any recent database configuration changes

2. **Short-term:**
   - Scale up web-service resources to handle the load until database issues are resolved
   - Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
   - Add retry logic with exponential backoff for database connections

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Continue monitoring memory usage as it's reached 100%
   - Watch for error rates in the web-service as they correlate directly with response time degradation

This appears to be a classic case of a database failure causing upstream API degradation, with resource exhaustion in the web-service as it attempts to handle the database connection failures.

### Application Logs Agent
- # API Response Time Degradation Analysis

Based on the log analysis, I've identified several critical issues causing the API response time degradation in the last hour.

## Root Causes Identified:

1. **Database Configuration Failure**
   - According to get_error_logs output, the database pod is failing with multiple critical errors:
     - "ConfigMap 'database-config' not found in namespace 'production'" (14:23:30)
     - "data directory '/var/lib/postgresql/data' has invalid permissions" (14:23:00)
     - "could not open configuration file '/etc/postgresql/database.conf'" (14:22:30)
   - These database failures are preventing proper database initialization

2. **Database Connection Timeouts**
   - According to search_logs results, the web-service is experiencing database connection issues:
     - "Database connection pool exhausted" (14:23:45)
     - "Database connection timeout after 5000ms" (14:23:46)
   - The analyze_log_patterns tool identified 15 occurrences of "Database connection timeout" errors

3. **Memory Exhaustion in Web Service**
   - According to get_error_logs, the web-service is experiencing OutOfMemoryErrors:
     - "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space" (14:24:30)
     - "Application shutting down due to critical error" (14:25:11)
   - The analyze_log_patterns tool detected 8 occurrences of OutOfMemoryError

4. **Slow Database Queries**
   - According to analyze_log_patterns, there were 25 occurrences of "Slow query detected"
   - Example: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE status='active' - Duration: 1250ms" (14:22:15)

## Impact Analysis:

1. **Error Distribution**
   - According to count_log_events, 77.8% of all errors are coming from the web-service
   - The api-service accounts for 17.8% of errors
   - This indicates the issue is primarily affecting the web-service

2. **Cascading Failure Pattern**
   - The logs show a clear progression:
     1. Database configuration failures (14:22:30)
     2. Database connection issues in web-service (14:23:45)
     3. Memory exhaustion in web-service (14:24:30)
     4. Application shutdown (14:25:11)

## Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate (Database Configuration)**
   - Verify the existence of ConfigMap 'database-config' in the production namespace
   - Check permissions on '/var/lib/postgresql/data' directory
   - Ensure the postgres user has proper ownership of data directories

2. **Short-term (Web Service)**
   - Increase heap memory allocation for the web-service to prevent OutOfMemoryErrors
   - Implement connection pooling improvements to handle database connection failures gracefully
   - Add circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures when database is unavailable

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Review and optimize the slow query "SELECT * FROM users WHERE status='active'"
   - Consider adding appropriate indexes to improve query performance

4. **Monitoring Improvements**
   - Set up alerts for database connection pool exhaustion
   - Monitor memory usage in web-service to catch growth trends before they become critical

The API response time degradation is primarily caused by database configuration issues that led to connection timeouts and eventually memory exhaustion in the web-service. Fixing the database configuration should resolve the immediate issue, while the other recommendations will improve resilience against similar problems in the future.
