# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 3 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) is in CrashLoopBackOff state, indicating repeated failures to start successfully
- **Impact**: Potential service instability for applications dependent on the database
- **Severity**: High - Critical database component is failing to start, while other services remain operational

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Investigate database pod logs to determine crash cause (`kubectl logs database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q`)
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Resolve database pod issues and monitor web-app pod which shows high memory usage (85%)
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement pod health monitoring alerts to catch CrashLoopBackOff conditions earlier
4. **Follow-up**: Review memory allocation for web-app-deployment pod as it's approaching resource limits (85% memory usage)

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Database pod is continuously crashing, potentially affecting data services
- Web-app pod memory usage at 85%, approaching resource limits which could lead to OOM kills

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- ## Pods in Production Namespace

Based on the output from `get_pod_status` tool, here are the pods running in your production namespace:

| Pod Name | Status | Node | Created At | CPU Usage | Memory Usage |
|----------|--------|------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p | Running | node-1 | 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z | 250m (75%) | 512Mi (85%) |
| database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q | CrashLoopBackOff | node-2 | 2024-01-15T09:15:00Z | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) |
| api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r | Running | node-3 | 2024-01-15T08:00:00Z | 150m (45%) | 256Mi (60%) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-h4k3m | Running | node-1 | 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z | 100m (25%) | 256Mi (40%) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-m8n2p | Running | node-2 | 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z | 95m (24%) | 248Mi (39%) |

**Note:** There appears to be an issue with the `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q` pod which is in CrashLoopBackOff state. You may want to investigate this further.

If you need to see pods in a different namespace, please specify the namespace name.

### Performance Metrics Agent
- I notice you're asking about pods in your infrastructure, but as the Performance Metrics Agent, I don't have direct access to pod listing functionality. My tools are focused on performance metrics, resource utilization, and availability statistics rather than Kubernetes resource management.

I can provide you with performance metrics for services in your infrastructure, which may help you understand how your applications are performing. Would you like me to show you performance metrics for specific services or resource utilization across your infrastructure?

To get information about pods specifically, you would need to use the Kubernetes Agent which has access to the `k8s-api___get_pod_status` function that can list pods in your infrastructure.

## ✅ Investigation Complete

All planned investigation steps have been executed.
