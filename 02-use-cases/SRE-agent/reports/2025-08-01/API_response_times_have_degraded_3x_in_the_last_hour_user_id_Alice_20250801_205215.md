# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** API response times have degraded 3x in the last hour

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database configuration failure - missing ConfigMap 'database-config' and permission issues on PostgreSQL data directory
- **Impact**: Severe performance degradation with API response times increasing from 150ms to 5000ms (33x increase)
- **Severity**: High - Web service experiencing memory errors (OutOfMemoryError) and 75% error rate, though still partially responsive

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Restore database ConfigMap 'database-config' in production namespace and fix PostgreSQL data directory permissions
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Address web-service memory issues by increasing Java heap space and optimizing UserService.loadAllUsers()
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Optimize slow database queries, particularly "SELECT * FROM users WHERE status='active'" with appropriate indexing
4. **Follow-up**: Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures and set up proactive alerts for database connection issues

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Database service experiencing 100% error rate with "ConfigMap not found" and "Permission denied" errors
- Web-service memory at 100% utilization with Java heap space errors
- CPU usage spiked from 25% to 95%, indicating severe resource exhaustion

## Technical Details
The issue shows a clear progression of failures:
1. Database configuration issues started at 14:22:30
2. Connection timeouts began at 14:23:46
3. Memory errors in web-service appeared at 14:24:30
4. Error rate increased from 0.5% to 75%

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Performance Metrics Agent
- ## Analysis Summary

Based on the metrics data, I can confirm a severe API response time degradation in the last hour:

### Response Time Degradation
According to the `get_performance_metrics` data, the web-service API response times have increased dramatically:
- Initial response time: 150ms at 14:20:00Z (source: get_performance_metrics)
- Current response time: 5000ms at 14:24:00Z (source: get_performance_metrics)
- This represents a **33x increase** in response time, confirming your observation of degradation

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Database Issues**:
   - According to `get_error_rates` data, the database service is experiencing 100% error rate with "ConfigMap not found" and "Permission denied on data directory" errors (source: get_error_rates)
   - These database failures started around the same time as the API degradation

2. **Resource Exhaustion**:
   - CPU usage: Increased from 25% to 95% (source: get_resource_metrics)
   - Memory usage: Reached 100% (1024MB) at 14:24:00Z (source: get_resource_metrics)
   - The web-service is likely experiencing resource starvation

3. **Error Rate Spike**:
   - Error rate increased from 0.5% to 75% (source: get_error_rates)
   - Server errors (500, 503) have dramatically increased
   - Sample count decreased from 100 to 20, indicating reduced throughput

4. **Trend Analysis**:
   - The `analyze_trends` tool confirms an increasing trend with significant anomalies
   - Latest measurements show 100% deviation from normal patterns (source: analyze_trends)

## Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Database Recovery**:
   - Fix the database ConfigMap issue and permission problems
   - The database errors are likely the primary cause of the API degradation

2. **Resource Scaling**:
   - Increase resources for the web-service to address CPU and memory exhaustion
   - Consider horizontal scaling to distribute load

3. **Error Investigation**:
   - Examine the 500-level errors in the web-service
   - These appear to be related to the database connectivity issues

4. **Traffic Management**:
   - Consider implementing circuit breakers or throttling to prevent cascading failures
   - Temporarily reduce load on the system while addressing the database issues

5. **Monitoring**:
   - Continue monitoring response times and error rates after implementing fixes
   - Watch for recovery patterns in the next 15-30 minutes

The primary issue appears to be database connectivity problems causing web-service degradation, compounded by resource exhaustion as the service attempts to handle the failures.

### Application Logs Agent
- ## Analysis Summary

Based on the log data, I've identified several critical issues causing the API response time degradation:

### 1. Database Connectivity Failures
According to the error logs, the database service is experiencing critical failures:
- **ConfigMap Missing**: "ConfigMap 'database-config' not found in namespace 'production'" (source: get_error_logs)
- **Permission Issues**: "data directory '/var/lib/postgresql/data' has invalid permissions" (source: get_error_logs)
- **Connection Timeouts**: Multiple "Database connection timeout after 5000ms" errors (source: analyze_log_patterns)

### 2. Memory Issues in Web Service
The web-service is experiencing severe memory problems:
- **OutOfMemoryError**: Java heap space errors starting at 14:24:30.789Z (source: get_error_logs)
- This is likely causing the service to crash or significantly slow down

### 3. Slow Database Queries
Before the complete database failure:
- 25 occurrences of "Slow query detected" with queries taking over 1250ms (source: analyze_log_patterns)
- These slow queries likely contributed to the initial response time degradation

### 4. Cascading Failures
The logs show a clear progression of failures:
1. Database configuration issues started around 14:22:30 (source: get_error_logs)
2. Connection timeouts began at 14:23:46 (source: get_error_logs)
3. Memory errors in the web-service appeared at 14:24:30 (source: get_error_logs)
4. Complete service failure by 14:25:11 (source: get_error_logs)

## Recommended Actions

1. **Restore Database Configuration**
   - Fix the missing ConfigMap 'database-config' in the production namespace
   - Correct the permissions on the PostgreSQL data directory
   - Restart the database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q)

2. **Address Memory Issues**
   - Increase the Java heap space allocation for the web-service
   - Consider implementing memory limits and requests in the Kubernetes deployment
   - Optimize the code in UserService.loadAllUsers() which is causing memory problems

3. **Optimize Database Queries**
   - Review and optimize the slow query: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE status='active'"
   - Consider adding appropriate indexes to improve query performance

4. **Implement Circuit Breakers**
   - Add circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures when the database is unavailable
   - Implement timeouts and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

5. **Monitoring Improvements**
   - Set up alerts for database connection failures
   - Monitor memory usage more proactively to catch issues before they cause outages

The primary root cause appears to be database configuration issues that led to connection failures, which then caused memory problems in the web-service as it attempted to handle the errors, ultimately resulting in the 3x API response time degradation.
