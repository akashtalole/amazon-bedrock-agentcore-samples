# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) in CrashLoopBackOff state, indicating repeated failures to start
- **Impact**: Potential service instability for database-dependent applications
- **Severity**: High - Critical database component failing with likely impact on business operations

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Investigate database pod logs to determine crash cause
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Implement database pod recovery plan and verify stability
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Review pod resource allocations - web-app pod showing high memory usage (85%)
4. **Follow-up**: Establish monitoring alert for database pod status in #carol-executive and #strategic-alerts channels

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Database service experiencing repeated crashes which may impact application availability
- Web-app pod approaching memory limits (85% utilization) which could lead to performance degradation

- ## Pods in Production Namespace

Based on the results from the `get_pod_status` tool, here are the pods currently running in your production namespace:

| Pod Name | Status | Node | Created At | CPU Usage | Memory Usage |
|----------|--------|------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p | Running | node-1 | 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z | 250m (75%) | 512Mi (85%) |
| database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q | CrashLoopBackOff | node-2 | 2024-01-15T09:15:00Z | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) |
| api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r | Running | node-3 | 2024-01-15T08:00:00Z | 150m (45%) | 256Mi (60%) |
