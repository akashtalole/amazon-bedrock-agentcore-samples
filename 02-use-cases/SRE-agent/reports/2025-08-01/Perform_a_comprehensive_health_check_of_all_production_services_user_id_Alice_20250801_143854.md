**Query:** Perform a comprehensive health check of all production services

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Missing ConfigMap 'database-config' in production namespace preventing PostgreSQL initialization
- **Impact**: Database service complete outage (5+ hours) causing cascading failures to web and API services
- **Severity**: Critical - Database service completely down with web service experiencing severe degradation (5000ms response times, 75% error rate)

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Create missing ConfigMap 'database-config' in production namespace with required database.conf configuration
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Fix data directory permissions for PostgreSQL and address web service memory exhaustion (currently at 100% utilization)
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement circuit breakers for database-dependent services and add ConfigMap validation in CI/CD pipeline
4. **Follow-up**: Escalate to alice.manager@company.com and sre-oncall@company.com if issues persist beyond 5 minutes; post updates to #alice-alerts and #sre-team channels

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) in CrashLoopBackOff state with 0/1 available replicas
- Web service experiencing OutOfMemoryError with Java heap space exhaustion
- Node-3 experiencing memory pressure (above 85% utilization)

### 🔧 Troubleshooting Steps
```bash
# 1. Create missing ConfigMap
kubectl create configmap database-config --from-literal=database.conf='shared_buffers=256MB
max_connections=100
log_destination=stderr' -n production

# 2. Fix data directory permissions
kubectl exec -it database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q -- chown -R postgres:postgres /var/lib/postgresql/data
