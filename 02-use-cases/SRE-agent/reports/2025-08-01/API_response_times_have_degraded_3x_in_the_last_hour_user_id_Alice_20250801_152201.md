# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** API response times have degraded 3x in the last hour

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database configuration failure due to missing ConfigMap 'database-config' in production namespace and permission issues on PostgreSQL data directory
- **Impact**: Severe API performance degradation with response times increasing from 150ms to 5000ms (33x increase)
- **Severity**: Critical - Database service failures causing 75% error rate, memory exhaustion in web-service, and 5x reduction in throughput

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Restore missing ConfigMap 'database-config' in production namespace and fix PostgreSQL data directory permissions
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Restart web-service pods to clear memory issues and implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Review deployment procedures to prevent ConfigMap deletion/misconfiguration and implement graceful degradation for database unavailability
4. **Follow-up**: Notify alice.manager@company.com and post status updates in #alice-alerts and #sre-team channels after resolution

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Web-service experiencing OutOfMemoryError causing application shutdowns
- Database connection pool exhausted with 5000ms timeouts
- Error rate increased from 0.5% to 75% with server errors (5xx) spiking from 5 to 148

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Performance Metrics Agent
- ## Analysis Summary

Based on the metrics data, I can confirm a severe API response time degradation in the last hour:

### Response Time Degradation
According to get_performance_metrics data:
- The web-service `/api/users` endpoint shows a dramatic increase in response time:
  - 14:20:00Z: 150ms
  - 14:24:00Z: 5000ms (33x increase)
- P95 response times increased from 200ms to 5000ms
- Sample count decreased from 100 to 20, indicating reduced throughput

### Resource Utilization Issues
According to get_resource_metrics data:
- CPU usage for web-service increased from 25% to 95% (source: get_resource_metrics)
- Memory usage reached 100% (1024MB) at 14:24:00Z (source: get_resource_metrics)
- The resource saturation correlates directly with the response time degradation

### Error Rate Spike
According to get_error_rates data:
- Error rate increased from 0.5% to 75% for web-service
- Server errors (5xx) increased dramatically from 5 to 148
- Total requests decreased from 1000 to 200, indicating service degradation

### Database Issues
According to get_error_rates data:
- The database service is showing persistent connection failures
- Error messages indicate "ConfigMap not found" and "Permission denied on data directory"
- These database issues likely explain the web-service degradation

### Trend Analysis
According to analyze_trends tool:
- Response time trend is "increasing" with an average of 2500ms
- Two anomalies detected at 14:23:00Z and 14:24:00Z with deviation percentages of 40% and 100%

## Root Cause and Recommendations

**Root Cause**: The API response time degradation appears to be caused by database connectivity issues. The web-service is unable to connect to the database due to configuration and permission problems, causing increased resource utilization as connection attempts pile up.

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Check the database ConfigMap - it appears to be missing or inaccessible
2. Verify database data directory permissions
3. Consider scaling up web-service resources temporarily to handle the load
4. Implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures

**Next Steps**:
1. Restore proper database configuration
2. Monitor response times after fixes to ensure recovery
3. Implement better alerting to catch these issues earlier
4. Review the deployment process that may have caused the ConfigMap issue

The metrics clearly show this is a critical issue affecting service availability and should be addressed immediately.

### Application Logs Agent
- ## Analysis Summary

Based on the log data, I've identified several critical issues causing the API response time degradation:

### 1. Database Connection Issues
According to get_error_logs data:
- The database service is experiencing critical failures:
  - Missing configuration file: `FATAL: could not open configuration file '/etc/postgresql/database.conf': No such file or directory` (14:22:30)
  - Permission issues: `FATAL: data directory '/var/lib/postgresql/data' has invalid permissions` (14:23:00)
  - Missing ConfigMap: `ERROR: ConfigMap 'database-config' not found in namespace 'production'` (14:23:30)
  - Failed liveness probe: `Container postgres failed liveness probe, will be restarted` (14:24:30)

### 2. Connection Pool Exhaustion
According to search_logs results:
- The web-service connection pool was exhausted: `Database connection pool exhausted, waiting for available connection` (14:23:45)
- Connection timeouts occurred: `Database connection timeout after 5000ms` (14:23:46)
- API service failed to connect: `Database connection failed after all retries` (14:22:05)

### 3. Memory Issues
According to get_error_logs data:
- The web-service experienced memory problems:
  - `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` (14:24:30)
  - `Application shutting down due to critical error` with reason `OutOfMemoryError` (14:25:11)

### 4. Slow Queries
According to analyze_log_patterns results:
- 25 occurrences of slow queries were detected between 14:22:15 and 14:23:45
- Example: `Slow query detected: SELECT * FROM users WHERE status='active' - Duration: 1250ms`

### 5. Error Distribution
According to count_log_events results:
- 77.8% of errors are from web-service (35 errors)
- 17.8% of errors are from api-service (8 errors)
- 4.4% of errors are from database-service (2 errors)

## Root Cause

The primary root cause appears to be database configuration issues. The database service is failing to start properly due to:
1. Missing ConfigMap 'database-config'
2. Permission problems with the data directory
3. Configuration file not found

These database failures are causing cascading issues:
- Web-service connection pool exhaustion
- Connection timeouts
- Slow queries
- Eventually memory errors as connection attempts pile up

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Restore the missing ConfigMap 'database-config' in the production namespace
   - Fix permissions on the PostgreSQL data directory: `chmod -R 700 /var/lib/postgresql/data && chown -R postgres:postgres /var/lib/postgresql/data`
   - Restart the database pod after fixing the configuration issues

2. **Secondary Actions:**
   - Restart the web-service pods to clear the memory issues
   - Increase connection timeout settings to prevent rapid failure cascades
   - Implement circuit breakers to fail fast when database is unavailable

3. **Monitoring Improvements:**
   - Add alerts for database configuration issues
   - Monitor connection pool utilization with lower thresholds
   - Set up alerts for slow query patterns

4. **Long-term Improvements:**
   - Review deployment procedures to prevent ConfigMap deletion/misconfiguration
   - Implement graceful degradation for database unavailability
   - Consider adding read replicas to distribute database load

The logs clearly indicate this is a critical infrastructure issue affecting service availability that requires immediate attention to the database configuration.
