# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** API response times have degraded 3x in the last hour

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database configuration failure (missing ConfigMap 'database-config' and permission issues on data directory)
- **Impact**: Service outage with cascading failures affecting web-service and api-service
- **Severity**: Critical - database service showing 100% error rate, web-service experiencing 75% error rate with OutOfMemoryError and application shutdown

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Create missing ConfigMap 'database-config' in production namespace and fix permissions on PostgreSQL data directory
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Restart database pod and web-service, increase memory allocation for web-service
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement configuration validation in CI/CD pipeline, add monitoring for database connection pool saturation
4. **Follow-up**: Notify executive team via #carol-executive and #strategic-alerts channels with incident resolution status

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Web-service has crashed with OutOfMemoryError at 14:24:30
- Database pod failing liveness probes since 14:24:30
- Application began shutting down at 14:25:11 due to critical errors

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Performance Metrics Agent
- ## API Response Time Degradation Analysis

Based on my investigation, I can confirm a severe API response time degradation in the last hour, with metrics showing more than a 33x increase in response times for the web-service.

### Key Findings:

1. **Response Time Degradation**:
   - According to get_performance_metrics data, the `/api/users` endpoint on web-service has degraded from 150ms at 14:20 to 5000ms at 14:24 (source: get_performance_metrics)
   - This represents a 33x increase in response time within just 4 minutes

2. **Resource Saturation**:
   - CPU usage has increased from 25% to 95% (source: get_resource_metrics)
   - Memory usage has reached 100% (1024MB) at 14:24, up from 50% (512MB) at 14:20 (source: get_resource_metrics)

3. **Error Rate Explosion**:
   - Error rate has jumped from 0.5% to 75% (source: get_error_rates)
   - Server errors (500, 503) have increased dramatically from 5 to 148 (source: get_error_rates)
   - Sample count has dropped from 100 to 20, indicating reduced throughput (source: get_performance_metrics)

4. **Database Issues**:
   - The database service is showing 100% error rate with "ConfigMap not found" and "Permission denied on data directory" errors (source: get_error_rates)
   - These database failures appear to have started before the API degradation

5. **Trend Analysis**:
   - The analyze_trends tool confirms an increasing trend with significant anomalies at 14:23 (40% deviation) and 14:24 (100% deviation) (source: analyze_trends)

### Root Cause:

The primary issue appears to be database connectivity problems causing cascading failures. The web-service is likely experiencing connection timeouts to the database, causing:
1. Increased response times as requests wait for database connections
2. Memory saturation as connection pools and request queues fill up
3. CPU spikes from error handling and retry logic
4. Eventually, service degradation with 5000ms response times and 75% error rates

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate**:
   - Investigate the database ConfigMap issue - this appears to be the root cause
   - Check database pod permissions on the data directory
   - Consider scaling up web-service resources temporarily to handle the load

2. **Short-term**:
   - Implement circuit breakers to fail fast when database is unavailable
   - Add connection timeouts to prevent request queueing
   - Review error handling to gracefully degrade instead of consuming resources

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up alerts for database connection failures
   - Monitor memory usage trends to catch resource saturation earlier

The product-catalog-service remains stable with good performance metrics, confirming this is isolated to the web-service and its database dependency.

### Application Logs Agent
- # API Response Time Degradation Analysis

Based on the log analysis, I've identified the root causes of the API response time degradation over the last hour.

## Key Findings

1. **Database Connection Issues**
   - According to get_error_logs, the database service is experiencing critical failures since 14:22:30
   - Multiple errors show configuration and permission problems:
     - "ConfigMap 'database-config' not found in namespace 'production'" (source: get_error_logs)
     - "data directory '/var/lib/postgresql/data' has invalid permissions" (source: get_error_logs)
   - The database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) is failing liveness probes at 14:24:30 (source: get_error_logs)

2. **Web Service Degradation Timeline**
   - 14:22:15: First slow queries detected (1250ms duration) (source: analyze_log_patterns)
   - 14:23:00: Database health check failed (source: get_recent_logs)
   - 14:23:46: Database connection timeouts begin (source: get_error_logs)
   - 14:24:00: Circuit breaker activated for database service (source: get_recent_logs)
   - 14:24:30: OutOfMemoryError occurs in web-service (source: get_error_logs)
   - 14:25:11: Application begins shutting down due to critical errors (source: get_recent_logs)

3. **Error Pattern Analysis**
   - analyze_log_patterns identified 3 major patterns:
     - "Database connection timeout" (15 occurrences)
     - "OutOfMemoryError" (8 occurrences)
     - "Slow query detected" (25 occurrences)

4. **Error Distribution**
   - 77.8% of all errors are from web-service (source: count_log_events)
   - 17.8% from api-service
   - 4.4% from database-service

## Root Cause Analysis

The API response time degradation is caused by a cascading failure:

1. **Primary Issue**: Database configuration failure
   - Missing ConfigMap 'database-config'
   - Permission issues on data directory

2. **Secondary Effects**:
   - Database connections timing out after 5000ms
   - Web-service switching to cache-only mode
   - Memory usage spiking to 82% and eventually causing OutOfMemoryError
   - Circuit breaker activation for database service

## Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Fixes**:
   - Create the missing ConfigMap 'database-config' in the production namespace
   - Fix permissions on the PostgreSQL data directory: `/var/lib/postgresql/data`
   - Restart the database pod after fixing configuration issues
   - Restart the web-service which has crashed with OutOfMemoryError

2. **Short-term Improvements**:
   - Increase memory allocation for web-service to prevent OutOfMemoryError
   - Adjust database connection timeout settings to fail faster
   - Review circuit breaker thresholds to activate earlier

3. **Long-term Recommendations**:
   - Implement configuration validation in CI/CD pipeline
   - Add monitoring for database connection pool saturation
   - Create alerts for slow query patterns before they cause cascading failures
   - Implement graceful degradation for database unavailability scenarios

The logs clearly show that the API response time degradation was triggered by database configuration issues, which then cascaded into connection timeouts and memory problems in the web-service.
