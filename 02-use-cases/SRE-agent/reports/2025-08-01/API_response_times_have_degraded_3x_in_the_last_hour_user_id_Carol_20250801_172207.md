# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** API response times have degraded 3x in the last hour

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database configuration failure - missing ConfigMap 'database-config' in production namespace and invalid permissions on PostgreSQL data directory
- **Impact**: Severe performance degradation in web-service API endpoints with 25x response time increase (150ms to 5000ms)
- **Severity**: High - Database service showing 100% error rate with cascading failures to web-service causing 75% error rate

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Create missing ConfigMap 'database-config' in production namespace and correct permissions on `/var/lib/postgresql/data` directory
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Restart web-service pods to clear OutOfMemoryError state and implement temporary rate limiting
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Optimize slow database query "SELECT * FROM users WHERE status='active'" and implement circuit breakers
4. **Follow-up**: Set up alerts for database connection pool exhaustion in #carol-executive and #strategic-alerts channels

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Web-service experiencing OutOfMemoryError with Java heap space exhaustion
- Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) failing with "Permission denied on data directory" error
- API error rate increased from 0.5% to 75% with significant business impact

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Performance Metrics Agent
- ## Analysis Summary

Based on the metrics data, I've identified a severe API response time degradation in the `web-service`:

### Response Time Degradation
According to `get_performance_metrics` data:
- The `/api/users` endpoint response time has increased dramatically from 150ms to 5000ms within the last hour
- P95 response time increased from 200ms to 5000ms (source: get_performance_metrics)
- Sample count has decreased from 100 to 20, indicating reduced throughput (source: get_performance_metrics)

### Resource Utilization Issues
According to `get_resource_metrics` data:
- CPU usage has spiked from 25% to 95% (source: get_resource_metrics)
- Memory usage has reached 100% (1024MB), up from 50% (512MB) (source: get_resource_metrics)
- This indicates resource exhaustion is likely contributing to the performance degradation

### Error Rate Correlation
According to `get_error_rates` data:
- Error rate has increased from 0.5% to 75% (source: get_error_rates)
- Server errors (500, 503) have significantly increased
- Total requests have dropped from 1000 to 200, suggesting service degradation

### Database Issues
According to `get_error_rates` data:
- The database service is showing 100% error rate with "connection_refused" errors
- Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) is failing with "Permission denied on data directory" error
- This database failure is likely the root cause of the web-service degradation

### Trend Analysis
According to `analyze_trends` data:
- Response time shows a clear increasing trend
- Average response time is 2500ms with a standard deviation of 1200ms
- Two anomalies detected at 14:23 and 14:24 with deviation percentages of 40% and 100% respectively

## Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Database Fix**:
   - Investigate and resolve the database permission issue on data directory
   - Check if recent changes were made to database configuration or permissions

2. **Resource Scaling**:
   - Scale up web-service resources to handle the current load
   - Consider horizontal scaling to distribute traffic

3. **Error Investigation**:
   - Examine server error logs for the specific 500/503 errors
   - Focus on the connection between web-service and database

4. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Continue monitoring response times after implementing fixes
   - Set up alerts for early detection of similar issues

5. **Traffic Management**:
   - Consider implementing circuit breakers or rate limiting if the issue persists
   - Temporarily redirect traffic if possible to reduce load

The primary root cause appears to be the database service failure with permission issues on the data directory, which has cascaded to the web-service causing increased response times, resource exhaustion, and high error rates.

### Application Logs Agent
- ## Analysis Summary

Based on the log data, I've identified several critical issues causing the API response time degradation:

### 1. Database Connection Issues
According to the logs-api___get_error_logs and logs-api___search_logs data:
- Database connection timeouts started at 14:23:46 (source: get_error_logs)
- Connection pool exhaustion warnings appeared at 14:23:45 (source: search_logs)
- Database connection failures after retry attempts at 14:22:05 (source: search_logs)

### 2. Database Service Failures
According to the logs-api___get_error_logs data:
- Missing configuration file: `/etc/postgresql/database.conf` at 14:22:30 (source: get_error_logs)
- Data directory permission issues: `/var/lib/postgresql/data` has invalid permissions at 14:23:00 (source: get_error_logs)
- ConfigMap 'database-config' not found in namespace 'production' at 14:23:30 (source: get_error_logs)
- Container liveness probe failures at 14:24:30 (source: get_error_logs)

### 3. Memory Issues in Web Service
According to the logs-api___get_error_logs and logs-api___analyze_log_patterns data:
- OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space at 14:24:30 (source: get_error_logs)
- Application shutdown due to critical failure at 14:25:11 (source: get_error_logs)
- 8 occurrences of OutOfMemoryError between 14:24:30 and 14:25:10 (source: analyze_log_patterns)

### 4. Slow Database Queries
According to the logs-api___analyze_log_patterns data:
- 25 occurrences of "Slow query detected" between 14:22:15 and 14:23:45 (source: analyze_log_patterns)
- Example: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE status='active'" taking 1250ms (source: analyze_log_patterns)

### 5. Error Distribution
According to the logs-api___count_log_events data:
- web-service: 77.8% of all errors (35 occurrences) (source: count_log_events)
- api-service: 17.8% of all errors (8 occurrences) (source: count_log_events)
- database-service: 4.4% of all errors (2 occurrences) (source: count_log_events)

## Root Cause Analysis

The primary root cause appears to be database configuration and permission issues:
1. Missing ConfigMap 'database-config' in production namespace
2. Invalid permissions on the PostgreSQL data directory
3. These database issues led to connection timeouts in the web-service
4. The web-service then experienced memory issues trying to handle the backlog of requests

## Recommended Actions

1. **Fix Database Configuration Issues**:
   - Create the missing ConfigMap 'database-config' in the production namespace
   - Correct permissions on `/var/lib/postgresql/data` directory to be owned by postgres user
   - Restart the database pod after fixing these issues

2. **Address Web Service Memory Issues**:
   - Increase Java heap space allocation for the web-service
   - Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
   - Consider implementing pagination for the `/api/users/bulk` endpoint to prevent memory exhaustion

3. **Optimize Database Queries**:
   - Review and optimize the slow query "SELECT * FROM users WHERE status='active'"
   - Consider adding appropriate indexes to improve query performance

4. **Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Set up alerts for database connection pool exhaustion
   - Monitor memory usage in the web-service to catch potential issues before they become critical

5. **Immediate Recovery Steps**:
   - Restart the web-service pods to clear the OutOfMemoryError state
   - Implement temporary rate limiting to prevent overwhelming the recovering system

These actions should address the immediate issues causing the API response time degradation and help prevent similar issues in the future.
