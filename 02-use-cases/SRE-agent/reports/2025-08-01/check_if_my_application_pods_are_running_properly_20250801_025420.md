# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** check if my application pods are running properly
**Status:** Step 3 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Missing database ConfigMap (`database-config`) preventing database pod startup, combined with insufficient memory allocation for web service
- **Impact**: Service outage - Database pod in CrashLoopBackOff state, web service experiencing OutOfMemoryError crashes
- **Severity**: **Critical** - Core database service completely down, cascading failures affecting entire application stack

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Create missing `database-config` ConfigMap in production namespace to restore database service
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Increase memory limits for web service pods to prevent OOM kills and fix database data directory permissions
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement ConfigMap validation in deployment pipeline and establish proper resource monitoring/alerting
4. **Follow-up**: Monitor database connection recovery and verify all 5 pods return to healthy running state

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- **Database service completely unavailable** - 0% resource utilization indicates total failure
- **15 database connection timeouts** and **8 OutOfMemoryError events** in the last hour
- **Only 3 of 5 application pods running properly** - 40% of application capacity offline
- **Cascading service failures** as web services cannot connect to failed database

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- ## Pod Status Summary (Production Namespace)

Based on get_pod_status tool output, here's the current status of your application pods:

### ✅ **Healthy Pods (3/5 running properly):**
- **web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p**: Running (CPU: 75%, Memory: 85%)
- **api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r**: Running (CPU: 45%, Memory: 60%) 
- **product-catalog-service** (2 replicas): Both running with healthy resource usage (~25% CPU, ~40% memory)

### ❌ **Critical Issue Identified:**
- **database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q**: **CrashLoopBackOff** status with 0% resource utilization

## Root Cause Analysis

According to get_cluster_events data, the database pod is failing due to:
1. **Missing ConfigMap**: "couldn't find key config/database.conf in ConfigMap production/database-config" (15 occurrences)
2. **PreStopHook failures**: PostgreSQL shutdown commands failing (12 occurrences)

## Additional Concerns

Per get_cluster_events tool results, the web-app pod shows:
- **Memory pressure**: "0/3 nodes are available: 3 Insufficient memory" (5 occurrences)
- **Readiness probe failures**: HTTP probe returning 503 status (3 occurrences)

## Immediate Action Required

The database pod failure is likely impacting your entire application stack. The missing database configuration is preventing the database from starting, which would cause downstream service failures.

**Note**: I checked the production namespace. If your application pods are in a different namespace, please specify it and I can check that namespace instead.

### Application Logs Agent
- ## Application Pod Health Analysis (Based on Log Data)

According to get_error_logs tool output, your application pods are experiencing **critical issues**:

### 🚨 **Critical Problems Identified:**

**Database Pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q):**
- **Configuration Missing**: "FATAL: could not open configuration file '/etc/postgresql/database.conf': No such file or directory" at 2024-01-15T14:22:30.123Z
- **ConfigMap Error**: "ERROR: ConfigMap 'database-config' not found in namespace 'production'" at 2024-01-15T14:23:30.012Z
- **Permission Issues**: "FATAL: data directory '/var/lib/postgresql/data' has invalid permissions" at 2024-01-15T14:23:00.789Z
- **Liveness Probe Failures**: "Container postgres failed liveness probe, will be restarted" at 2024-01-15T14:24:30.345Z

**Web Service Pod:**
- **Memory Exhaustion**: "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space" at 2024-01-15T14:24:30.789Z (source: get_error_logs)
- **Application Shutdown**: "Application shutting down due to critical error" at 2024-01-15T14:25:11.456Z
- **Database Connectivity**: "Database connection timeout after 5000ms" starting at 2024-01-15T14:23:46.567Z

### 📊 **Pattern Analysis Results:**

Based on analyze_log_patterns tool data:
- **Database connection timeouts**: 15 occurrences in the last hour
- **OutOfMemoryError events**: 8 critical occurrences 
- **Slow query warnings**: 25 occurrences indicating performance degradation

### 🔍 **Root Cause Assessment:**

According to search_logs tool results: No recent startup or health check success messages found, indicating pods are not successfully initializing.

**Primary Issues:**
1. **Database pod is in crash loop** due to missing ConfigMap and configuration files
2. **Web service experiencing memory pressure** leading to OOM kills and restarts
3. **Cascading failures** as web service cannot connect to failed database

### 💡 **Immediate Actions Required:**

1. **Fix Database ConfigMap**: Create missing 'database-config' ConfigMap in production namespace
2. **Increase Memory Limits**: Web service needs higher memory allocation to prevent OOM errors
3. **Check File Permissions**: Database data directory permissions need correction

Your application pods are **not running properly** - the database pod is failing to start due to configuration issues, and the web service is experiencing memory exhaustion. This requires immediate intervention to restore service availability.

For detailed Kubernetes pod management and resource adjustments, I recommend consulting with the Kubernetes Operations Agent who specializes in pod lifecycle management and resource allocation.

## ✅ Investigation Complete

All planned investigation steps have been executed.
