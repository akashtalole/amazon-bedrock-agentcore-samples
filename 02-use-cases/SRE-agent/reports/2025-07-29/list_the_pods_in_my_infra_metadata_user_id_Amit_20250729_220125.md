# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) is in CrashLoopBackOff state, repeatedly crashing and unable to maintain stable operation
- **Impact**: Database service instability affecting dependent applications
- **Severity**: High - Critical database component failing while other services remain operational

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Investigate database pod logs to determine crash cause
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Restore database stability through pod replacement or configuration fixes
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement database redundancy and failover mechanisms
4. **Follow-up**: Review memory allocation for web-app-deployment pod (85% usage)

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Database pod in CrashLoopBackOff state on node-2, potentially impacting all database-dependent services

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- ## Pods in Production Namespace

Based on the `get_pod_status` tool output, here are the pods in your production namespace:

| Pod Name | Status | Node | Created At | CPU Usage | Memory Usage |
|----------|--------|------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p | Running | node-1 | 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z | 250m (75%) | 512Mi (85%) |
| database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q | CrashLoopBackOff | node-2 | 2024-01-15T09:15:00Z | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) |
| api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r | Running | node-3 | 2024-01-15T08:00:00Z | 150m (45%) | 256Mi (60%) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-h4k3m | Running | node-1 | 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z | 100m (25%) | 256Mi (40%) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-m8n2p | Running | node-2 | 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z | 95m (24%) | 248Mi (39%) |

**Note:** I've detected that the `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q` is in a **CrashLoopBackOff** state, which indicates it's repeatedly crashing. You may want to investigate this issue.

If you'd like to check pods in a different namespace, please let me know which namespace you're interested in.

## 📋 Next Steps

3. Provide a summary of pod distribution across nodes and highlight any potential issues
