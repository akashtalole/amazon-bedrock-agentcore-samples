# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod (`database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q`) is in CrashLoopBackOff state, repeatedly crashing and restarting
- **Impact**: Database service instability - pod is failing to maintain running state
- **Severity**: High - critical database component is non-functional while other services remain operational

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Investigate database pod logs to determine crash cause
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Implement fix for database pod crash issue and verify stability
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Review database pod resource allocation and implement monitoring alerts for CrashLoopBackOff conditions
4. **Follow-up**: Assess impact on dependent services (web-app, api-service) that may be affected by database unavailability

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Database service is currently unavailable due to pod crash cycle, potentially affecting application functionality

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- ## Pods in Production Namespace

Based on the `get_pod_status` tool output, here are the pods in your production namespace:

| Pod Name | Status | Node | Created At | CPU Usage | Memory Usage |
|----------|--------|------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p | Running | node-1 | 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z | 75% (250m) | 85% (512Mi) |
| database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q | CrashLoopBackOff | node-2 | 2024-01-15T09:15:00Z | 0% (0) | 0% (0) |
| api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r | Running | node-3 | 2024-01-15T08:00:00Z | 45% (150m) | 60% (256Mi) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-h4k3m | Running | node-1 | 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z | 25% (100m) | 40% (256Mi) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-m8n2p | Running | node-2 | 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z | 24% (95m) | 39% (248Mi) |

**Note:** I've checked the production namespace by default. If you'd like to see pods in a different namespace, please let me know which namespace you're interested in.

**Warning:** I noticed that the `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q` is in a CrashLoopBackOff state. This indicates the pod is repeatedly crashing and restarting. Would you like me to investigate this issue further?
