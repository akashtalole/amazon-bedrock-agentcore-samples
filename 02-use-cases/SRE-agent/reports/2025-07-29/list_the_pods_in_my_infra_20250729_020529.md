# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 3 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod in CrashLoopBackOff state, indicating repeated container failures and restart attempts
- **Impact**: Service instability - critical database infrastructure component failing, potentially affecting dependent services
- **Severity**: **Critical** - Database failure can cascade to all application services (web-app, api-service, product-catalog-service)

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Investigate database pod logs and restart cause to restore database connectivity
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Verify data integrity and restore stable database service
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement database health monitoring and automated failover mechanisms
4. **Follow-up**: Review resource allocation for web-app pod showing high memory utilization (85%)

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- **Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) in CrashLoopBackOff** - Immediate investigation required as this affects all application services
- **Web-app pod at 85% memory utilization** - Monitor for potential memory pressure issues

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- Based on the `get_pod_status` tool output, here are the pods currently in your production namespace infrastructure:

## Pod Inventory - Production Namespace

**Total Pods: 5**

### Running Pods (4):
1. **web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p**
   - Status: Running | Node: node-1
   - Resources: 250m CPU (75%), 512Mi Memory (85%)
   - Created: 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z

2. **api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r**
   - Status: Running | Node: node-3
   - Resources: 150m CPU (45%), 256Mi Memory (60%)
   - Created: 2024-01-15T08:00:00Z

3. **product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-h4k3m**
   - Status: Running | Node: node-1
   - Resources: 100m CPU (25%), 256Mi Memory (40%)
   - Created: 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z

4. **product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-m8n2p**
   - Status: Running | Node: node-2
   - Resources: 95m CPU (24%), 248Mi Memory (39%)
   - Created: 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z

### Failed Pods (1):
1. **database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q**
   - Status: **CrashLoopBackOff** | Node: node-2
   - Phase: Failed
   - Resources: 0 CPU (0%), 0 Memory (0%)
   - Created: 2024-01-15T09:15:00Z

⚠️ **Critical Issue Detected**: According to get_pod_status tool data, the database pod is in CrashLoopBackOff state, which indicates a critical infrastructure problem that needs immediate attention.

**Note**: I checked the production namespace. If you need to see pods in other namespaces (like kube-system, default, staging, etc.), please specify the namespace name.

Would you like me to investigate the failing database pod or check pods in additional namespaces?

## ✅ Investigation Complete

All planned investigation steps have been executed.
