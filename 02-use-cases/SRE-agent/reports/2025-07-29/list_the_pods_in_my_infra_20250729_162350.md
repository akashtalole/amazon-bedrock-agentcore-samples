# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) is in CrashLoopBackOff state, repeatedly crashing and restarting
- **Impact**: Potential service instability for database-dependent applications
- **Severity**: High - Critical database component failing with likely impact on dependent services

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Check database pod logs to identify crash reason (`kubectl logs database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q`)
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Resolve database pod crash issue and verify stability
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement monitoring alerts for pod status and implement database redundancy
4. **Follow-up**: Review application dependencies on the database to improve resilience

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Database service is repeatedly crashing which may impact application availability and data integrity

- # Pods in Production Namespace

I've checked the production namespace for you. Here are the pods currently running in your infrastructure:

Based on the `get_pod_status` tool results:

| Pod Name | Status | Node | CPU Usage | Memory Usage |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|-------------|
| web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p | Running | node-1 | 75% (250m) | 85% (512Mi) |
| database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q | **CrashLoopBackOff** | node-2 | 0% (0) | 0% (0) |
| api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r | Running | node-3 | 45% (150m) | 60% (256Mi) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-h4k3m | Running | node-1 | 25% (100m) | 40% (256Mi) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-m8n2p | Running | node-2 | 24% (95m) | 39% (248Mi) |

**Note:** I've identified one pod in a problematic state - the database pod is in CrashLoopBackOff status. This indicates the pod is repeatedly crashing and restarting.

If you'd like to check pods in a different namespace, please let me know which namespace you're interested in.

## 📋 Next Steps

3. Provide a summary of pod count by namespace and status
