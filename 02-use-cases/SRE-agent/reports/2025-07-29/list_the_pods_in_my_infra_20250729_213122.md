# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod (`database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q`) is in CrashLoopBackOff state, indicating repeated failures to start successfully
- **Impact**: Potential service instability for database-dependent applications
- **Severity**: High - Database service is failing to run while other services remain operational

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Check database pod logs to identify specific crash reason
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Resolve database pod startup issues and verify stability
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement monitoring alerts for pod status and implement database redundancy
4. **Follow-up**: Review memory usage on web-app pod (85% utilization) to prevent potential issues

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Database pod is repeatedly crashing, which may impact data availability for connected services

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- ## Pods in Production Namespace

Based on the `get_pod_status` tool output, here are the pods in your production namespace:

| Pod Name | Status | Node | CPU Usage | Memory Usage |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|-------------|
| web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p | Running | node-1 | 75% (250m) | 85% (512Mi) |
| database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q | CrashLoopBackOff | node-2 | 0% (0) | 0% (0) |
| api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r | Running | node-3 | 45% (150m) | 60% (256Mi) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-h4k3m | Running | node-1 | 25% (100m) | 40% (256Mi) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-m8n2p | Running | node-2 | 24% (95m) | 39% (248Mi) |

**Note:** I've detected that one pod (`database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q`) is in `CrashLoopBackOff` state, which indicates an issue that may need attention.

If you'd like to see pods in a different namespace, please specify the namespace name, and I'll retrieve that information for you.

## 📋 Next Steps

3. Collect node allocation information to understand pod distribution across nodes
