# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) is in CrashLoopBackOff state, indicating repeated failures to start successfully
- **Impact**: Potential database service instability affecting applications that depend on this database
- **Severity**: High - Critical database component is failing to run, though other services remain operational

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Investigate database pod logs to determine crash cause
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Restore database service functionality and verify dependent applications
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement monitoring alerts for pod status and implement database redundancy
4. **Follow-up**: Review web-app-deployment memory usage (85%) to prevent potential memory pressure issues

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Database pod is repeatedly crashing, potentially affecting application data access and persistence

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- ## Pods in Production Namespace

Based on the `get_pod_status` tool output, here are the pods running in your production namespace:

| Pod Name | Status | Node | Created At | CPU Usage | Memory Usage |
|----------|--------|------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p | Running | node-1 | 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z | 250m (75%) | 512Mi (85%) |
| database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q | CrashLoopBackOff | node-2 | 2024-01-15T09:15:00Z | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) |
| api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r | Running | node-3 | 2024-01-15T08:00:00Z | 150m (45%) | 256Mi (60%) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-h4k3m | Running | node-1 | 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z | 100m (25%) | 256Mi (40%) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-m8n2p | Running | node-2 | 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z | 95m (24%) | 248Mi (39%) |

**Note:** I've checked the production namespace by default. If you'd like to see pods in a different namespace, please let me know and I can check that for you.

**Warning:** According to the `get_pod_status` output, there's an issue with the `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q` pod which is in CrashLoopBackOff state. This may require investigation.

## 📋 Next Steps

3. Identify any pods with issues or abnormal states
