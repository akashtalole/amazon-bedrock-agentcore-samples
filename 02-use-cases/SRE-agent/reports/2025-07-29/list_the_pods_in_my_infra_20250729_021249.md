# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) is in CrashLoopBackOff state on node-2
- **Impact**: Potential service instability for database-dependent applications
- **Severity**: High - Database pod is completely failing to start, which likely affects data access for other services

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Check database pod logs to identify crash reason (`kubectl logs database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q`)
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Resolve database pod crash issue and verify stability
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement database pod health monitoring and automated alerts
4. **Follow-up**: Review memory allocation for web-app-deployment pod which is at 85% capacity

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Database service is currently unavailable due to pod crash loop
- Web-app-deployment pod is approaching memory limits (85% usage) which may cause future instability

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- Here are the pods in your production namespace:

| Pod Name | Status | Node | CPU Usage | Memory Usage |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|-------------|
| web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p | Running | node-1 | 250m (75%) | 512Mi (85%) |
| database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q | CrashLoopBackOff | node-2 | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) |
| api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r | Running | node-3 | 150m (45%) | 256Mi (60%) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-h4k3m | Running | node-1 | 100m (25%) | 256Mi (40%) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-m8n2p | Running | node-2 | 95m (24%) | 248Mi (39%) |

Based on the get_pod_status tool output, I notice that most pods are running normally, but there's one pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) in CrashLoopBackOff state that might need attention.

If you'd like to see pods in a different namespace or get more details about any specific pod, please let me know.

## 📋 Next Steps

3. Provide a summary of pod count by namespace and status
