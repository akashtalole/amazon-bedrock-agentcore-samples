# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) in CrashLoopBackOff state, indicating repeated startup failures
- **Impact**: Potential service instability for database-dependent applications
- **Severity**: High - Critical database component failing to start while web-app showing high resource utilization (75% CPU, 85% memory)

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Investigate database pod logs to determine crash cause
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Resolve database pod startup issues and monitor web-app resource usage
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement resource limits/requests review for web-app to prevent potential memory issues
4. **Follow-up**: Consider load balancing evaluation for web-app-deployment to reduce resource pressure on node-1

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Web-app pod approaching memory limits (85% usage) which could lead to OOM kills
- Database pod failures may impact application functionality requiring database access

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- Here are the pods in your production namespace:

| Pod Name | Status | Node | CPU Usage | Memory Usage |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|-------------|
| web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p | Running | node-1 | 75% (250m) | 85% (512Mi) |
| database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q | CrashLoopBackOff | node-2 | 0% (0) | 0% (0) |
| api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r | Running | node-3 | 45% (150m) | 60% (256Mi) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-h4k3m | Running | node-1 | 25% (100m) | 40% (256Mi) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-m8n2p | Running | node-2 | 24% (95m) | 39% (248Mi) |

Based on the get_pod_status tool output, I've found 5 pods in the production namespace. Note that one pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) is in CrashLoopBackOff state, which indicates it's having issues starting up.

If you'd like to see pods in a different namespace, please let me know which namespace you're interested in.

## 📋 Next Steps

3. Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent will examine node status to verify the infrastructure health using get_node_status tool
