# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) is in CrashLoopBackOff state, indicating repeated failures to start successfully
- **Impact**: Potential database service instability affecting applications that depend on this database
- **Severity**: High - Critical database component failing to start while other services remain operational

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Investigate database pod logs to determine crash cause
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Restore database service functionality and verify dependent applications
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement monitoring alerts for pod crash states and review database pod resource allocations
4. **Follow-up**: Review application resilience to database failures

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Database pod is repeatedly crashing which may impact application functionality that depends on database services

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- Here are the pods in your production namespace:

| Pod Name | Status | Node | Created At | CPU Usage | Memory Usage |
|----------|--------|------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p | Running | node-1 | 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z | 250m (75%) | 512Mi (85%) |
| database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q | CrashLoopBackOff | node-2 | 2024-01-15T09:15:00Z | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) |
| api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r | Running | node-3 | 2024-01-15T08:00:00Z | 150m (45%) | 256Mi (60%) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-h4k3m | Running | node-1 | 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z | 100m (25%) | 256Mi (40%) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-m8n2p | Running | node-2 | 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z | 95m (24%) | 248Mi (39%) |

**Note:** I've checked the production namespace by default. If you'd like to see pods in a different namespace, please let me know which namespace you're interested in.

**Warning:** According to the get_pod_status tool output, there's an issue with the database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q pod which is in CrashLoopBackOff state. This might require investigation.

## 📋 Next Steps

3. Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent will use get_node_status to check the status of nodes hosting these pods
