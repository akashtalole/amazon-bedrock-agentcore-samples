# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 3 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q` is in CrashLoopBackOff state, indicating repeated container startup failures
- **Impact**: Service instability - database service unavailable while other application services remain operational
- **Severity**: **High** - Database failure likely affects dependent services (web-app and api-service) and could lead to data access issues

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Investigate database pod logs to identify crash cause and attempt manual restart
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Restore database service functionality and verify dependent service connectivity
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement database pod health monitoring and automated recovery procedures
4. **Follow-up**: Review resource allocation for web-app pod showing high memory usage (85%)

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- **Database service down**: CrashLoopBackOff status indicates complete database pod failure requiring immediate intervention
- **Resource pressure**: Web-app pod consuming 85% memory allocation may indicate potential scaling needs

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- Based on the `get_pod_status` tool output, here are the pods currently in your production infrastructure:

## Production Namespace Pod Inventory

| Pod Name | Status | Phase | Node | CPU Usage | Memory Usage | Created |
|----------|--------|-------|------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p** | Running | Running | node-1 | 250m (75%) | 512Mi (85%) | 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z |
| **database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q** | ⚠️ CrashLoopBackOff | Failed | node-2 | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) | 2024-01-15T09:15:00Z |
| **api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r** | Running | Running | node-3 | 150m (45%) | 256Mi (60%) | 2024-01-15T08:00:00Z |
| **product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-h4k3m** | Running | Running | node-1 | 100m (25%) | 256Mi (40%) | 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z |
| **product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-m8n2p** | Running | Running | node-2 | 95m (24%) | 248Mi (39%) | 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z |

## Infrastructure Summary
According to get_pod_status tool data:
- **Total pods**: 5
- **Healthy pods**: 4 (Running state)
- **Unhealthy pods**: 1 (Failed state)
- **Node distribution**: Spread across node-1, node-2, and node-3

## Critical Issue Detected
⚠️ **Immediate attention required**: The `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q` is in CrashLoopBackOff status (source: get_pod_status tool), indicating repeated container failures.

**Note**: This shows pods from the production namespace. If you need to see pods from other namespaces (such as `kube-system`, `default`, or custom namespaces), please specify the namespace and I can retrieve that information for you.

## ✅ Investigation Complete

All planned investigation steps have been executed.
