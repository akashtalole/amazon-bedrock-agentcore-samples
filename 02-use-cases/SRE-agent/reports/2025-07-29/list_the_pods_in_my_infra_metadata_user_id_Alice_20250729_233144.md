# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) is in CrashLoopBackOff state, repeatedly crashing and unable to start successfully
- **Impact**: Database service instability - pod is non-functional while other services remain operational
- **Severity**: High - critical database component failing while web and API services continue running

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Check database pod logs to identify specific crash reason
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Restore database service functionality and verify data integrity
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement monitoring alerts for pod crash states and database health
4. **Follow-up**: Review database resource allocation and crash recovery procedures

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Database pod on node-2 is repeatedly crashing, potentially affecting applications that depend on database services

- # Pods in Production Namespace

Based on the `get_pod_status` tool output, here are the pods running in your production namespace:

| Pod Name | Status | Node | Created At | CPU Usage | Memory Usage |
|----------|--------|------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p | Running | node-1 | 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z | 75% (250m) | 85% (512Mi) |
| database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q | CrashLoopBackOff | node-2 | 2024-01-15T09:15:00Z | 0% (0) | 0% (0) |
| api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r | Running | node-3 | 2024-01-15T08:00:00Z | 45% (150m) | 60% (256Mi) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-h4k3m | Running | node-1 | 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z | 25% (100m) | 40% (256Mi) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-m8n2p | Running | node-2 | 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z | 24% (95m) | 39% (248Mi) |

**Note:** I've checked the production namespace by default. If you'd like to see pods in a different namespace, please let me know and I can check that for you.

**Warning:** According to the `get_pod_status` output, the `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q` is in a CrashLoopBackOff state, which indicates it's repeatedly crashing. You may want to investigate this issue.

## 📋 Next Steps

3. Identify any pods with non-running status for potential issues
