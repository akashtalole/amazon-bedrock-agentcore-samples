# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) is in CrashLoopBackOff state on node-2
- **Impact**: Potential database service instability while web and API services remain operational
- **Severity**: High - Database pod is completely failing to start, likely affecting database-dependent services

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Investigate database pod logs to determine crash cause
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Restore database service functionality and verify dependent services
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement monitoring alerts for pod crash states and high resource utilization
4. **Follow-up**: Review web-app resource allocation as it's showing high utilization (75% CPU, 85% memory)

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Web-app pod (web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p) is approaching resource limits at 85% memory utilization, which could lead to OOM issues

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- ## Pods in Production Namespace

Based on the results from the `get_pod_status` tool, here are the pods currently running in your production namespace:

| Pod Name | Status | Node | CPU Utilization | Memory Utilization |
|----------|--------|------|----------------|-------------------|
| web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p | Running | node-1 | 75% | 85% |
| database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q | CrashLoopBackOff | node-2 | 0% | 0% |
| api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r | Running | node-3 | 45% | 60% |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-h4k3m | Running | node-1 | 25% | 40% |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-m8n2p | Running | node-2 | 24% | 39% |

**Note:** I've checked the production namespace by default. If you'd like to see pods in a different namespace, please let me know which namespace you're interested in.

**Warning:** I've detected that the `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q` is in a CrashLoopBackOff state, which may require attention.

## 📋 Next Steps

3. Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent will use get_node_status to check the nodes where these pods are running
