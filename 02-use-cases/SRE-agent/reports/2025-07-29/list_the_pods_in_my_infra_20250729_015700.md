# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 3 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) is in CrashLoopBackOff state, indicating repeated startup failures
- **Impact**: Service instability - database service unavailable while other application services remain operational
- **Severity**: **Critical** - Database failure typically affects all dependent application functionality and data access

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Investigate database pod logs and restart causes to restore database service
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Monitor web-app-deployment resource usage (85% memory, 75% CPU) for potential scaling needs
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement database pod health checks and resource limits to prevent future crashes
4. **Follow-up**: Review overall cluster resource allocation and establish monitoring alerts for pod failures

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- **Database service completely unavailable** - CrashLoopBackOff indicates persistent startup failures requiring immediate intervention
- **Web application under resource pressure** - 85% memory utilization may lead to performance degradation or failures

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- According to `get_pod_status` tool output, here are the pods currently in your production namespace:

## Production Namespace Pods

| Pod Name | Status | Phase | Node | CPU Usage | Memory Usage | Created |
|----------|--------|-------|------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p** | Running | Running | node-1 | 250m (75%) | 512Mi (85%) | 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z |
| **database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q** | ⚠️ CrashLoopBackOff | Failed | node-2 | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) | 2024-01-15T09:15:00Z |
| **api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r** | Running | Running | node-3 | 150m (45%) | 256Mi (60%) | 2024-01-15T08:00:00Z |
| **product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-h4k3m** | Running | Running | node-1 | 100m (25%) | 256Mi (40%) | 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z |
| **product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-m8n2p** | Running | Running | node-2 | 95m (24%) | 248Mi (39%) | 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z |

## Infrastructure Summary
- **Total pods**: 5
- **Running pods**: 4
- **Failed pods**: 1

⚠️ **Critical Issue Detected**: Based on `get_pod_status` data, the database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q is in CrashLoopBackOff state and requires immediate attention.

**Resource Utilization Overview** (source: get_pod_status tool):
- Highest CPU usage: web-app-deployment (75%)
- Highest memory usage: web-app-deployment (85%)
- Product catalog services are running efficiently with low resource consumption

If you need to see pods from other namespaces (default, kube-system, staging, etc.), please specify the namespace and I can retrieve that information for you.

## ✅ Investigation Complete

All planned investigation steps have been executed.
