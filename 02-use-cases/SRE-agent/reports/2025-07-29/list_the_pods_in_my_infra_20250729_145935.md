# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) is in CrashLoopBackOff state, repeatedly failing to start
- **Impact**: Potential service instability for database-dependent applications
- **Severity**: High - Critical database component failing while web and API services remain operational

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Investigate database pod logs to determine crash cause
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Restore database service functionality and verify dependent services
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement monitoring alerts for pod crash states
4. **Follow-up**: Review resource allocation for web-app pod showing high CPU (75%) and memory (85%) usage

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Database pod is repeatedly crashing, potentially affecting data availability
- Web-app pod approaching resource limits which could lead to performance degradation

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- ## Pods in Production Namespace

Based on the results from the `get_pod_status` tool, here are the pods in your production namespace:

| Pod Name | Status | Node | CPU Usage | Memory Usage |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|-------------|
| web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p | Running | node-1 | 75% (250m) | 85% (512Mi) |
| database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q | CrashLoopBackOff | node-2 | 0% (0) | 0% (0) |
| api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r | Running | node-3 | 45% (150m) | 60% (256Mi) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-h4k3m | Running | node-1 | 25% (100m) | 40% (256Mi) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-m8n2p | Running | node-2 | 24% (95m) | 39% (248Mi) |

**Note:** I've checked the 'production' namespace by default. If you'd like to see pods in a different namespace, please let me know and I can check that for you.

**Warning:** I noticed that the `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q` is in a CrashLoopBackOff state, which indicates it's repeatedly crashing. You may want to investigate this issue further.

## 📋 Next Steps

3. Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent will examine node status to verify where pods are running using get_node_status tool
