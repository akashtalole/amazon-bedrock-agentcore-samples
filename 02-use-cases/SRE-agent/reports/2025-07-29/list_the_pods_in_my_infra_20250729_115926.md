# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod (`database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q`) is in CrashLoopBackOff state, indicating repeated failures to start successfully
- **Impact**: Potential database service instability while other services remain operational
- **Severity**: High - Critical database component failing with likely impact on dependent services

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Check database pod logs to identify specific crash reason
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Resolve database pod issues and verify stability
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement monitoring alerts for pod status and implement database redundancy
4. **Follow-up**: Review memory allocation for web-app-deployment pod (currently at 85% usage)

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Database pod repeatedly crashing may impact data availability and application functionality
- Web-app-deployment pod showing high resource utilization (CPU 75%, Memory 85%) which could lead to performance issues

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- ## Pods in Production Namespace

Based on the `get_pod_status` tool output, here are the pods in your production namespace:

| Pod Name | Status | Node | CPU Usage | Memory Usage |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|-------------|
| web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p | Running | node-1 | 75% (250m) | 85% (512Mi) |
| database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q | CrashLoopBackOff | node-2 | 0% (0) | 0% (0) |
| api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r | Running | node-3 | 45% (150m) | 60% (256Mi) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-h4k3m | Running | node-1 | 25% (100m) | 40% (256Mi) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-m8n2p | Running | node-2 | 24% (95m) | 39% (248Mi) |

**Note:** I've checked the 'production' namespace by default. If you'd like to see pods in a different namespace, please let me know and I can check that for you.

**Warning:** I noticed that the `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q` is in a CrashLoopBackOff state, which indicates there's an issue with this pod. Would you like me to investigate this further?

## 📋 Next Steps

3. Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent will use get_node_status to check the nodes where pods are running
