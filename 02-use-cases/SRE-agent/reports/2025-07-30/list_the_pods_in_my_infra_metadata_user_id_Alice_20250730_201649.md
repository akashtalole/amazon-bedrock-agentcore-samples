# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Investigation incomplete - the agent attempted to list pods in the production namespace but no results were returned
- **Impact**: Unable to determine - insufficient data from the investigation
- **Severity**: Low - no evidence of service issues, only an incomplete query execution

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Complete the pod listing operation with proper authentication or permissions
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Verify if the production namespace exists and contains any pods
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement better error handling in monitoring tools to provide clear feedback when commands fail
4. **Follow-up**: Review agent permissions to ensure it can properly access Kubernetes resources

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- I'll help you list the pods in your infrastructure. Since you didn't specify a namespace, I'll check the 'production' namespace first. Let me do that for you.

```
kubectl get pods -n production
```

Let me retrieve that information for you.

I'll use the get_pod_status tool to list the pods in the production namespace:

```python
get_pod_status(namespace="production")
```

## 📋 Next Steps

3. Provide a summary of pod count by namespace and status
