**Query:** list the pods in my infra metadata: { user_id: Alice}

# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Investigation incomplete - the agent attempted to check pods in the production namespace but did not return any results
- **Impact**: Unable to determine - investigation did not complete or return pod information
- **Severity**: Low - this appears to be an information request that didn't complete rather than a service issue

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Retry the pod listing command with explicit namespace specification
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Verify Kubernetes API access permissions for the querying agent
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement better error handling for incomplete Kubernetes queries
4. **Follow-up**: Document common troubleshooting steps for Kubernetes information retrieval issues

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- I'll help you list the pods in your infrastructure. Since you didn't specify a namespace, I'll check the 'production' namespace first. Let me retrieve that information for you.

```
Checking pods in the production namespace...
```

I'll use the get_pod_status tool to retrieve this information.

## 📋 Next Steps

3. Provide a summary of pod count by namespace and status
