# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

The investigation results don't contain any actual pod information or error messages. The agent attempted to run commands to list pods but no results were returned in the transcript.

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Incomplete investigation - commands were initiated but no results were returned
- **Impact**: Unable to determine - investigation did not complete or return any pod information
- **Severity**: Low - this appears to be an information gathering request rather than an incident

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Re-run the pod listing command with proper authentication and namespace specification
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Verify agent has proper permissions to access Kubernetes resources
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement better error handling and feedback for incomplete command execution
4. **Follow-up**: Review agent logging to understand why command results weren't returned

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- I'll help you list the pods in your infrastructure. Since you didn't specify a namespace, I'll check the 'production' namespace first. Let me do that for you.

```
kubectl get pods -n production
```

Let me retrieve that information for you.

I'll use the get_pod_status tool to list the pods in the production namespace.

## 📋 Next Steps

3. Compile a comprehensive list of all pods with their current status
