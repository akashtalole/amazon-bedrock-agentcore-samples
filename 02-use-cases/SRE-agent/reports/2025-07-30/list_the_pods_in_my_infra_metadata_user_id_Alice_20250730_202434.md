# üîç Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

I don't have sufficient information to generate a meaningful executive summary. The investigation results show that commands were attempted to list pods in the production namespace, but no actual output or results from these commands were provided.

The investigation appears incomplete as:
- No pod data was returned
- No error messages were captured
- No system state information was provided
- No indication of success or failure of the commands

To generate an executive summary, I would need the actual output from the commands showing pod status, any error messages, or confirmation that the commands executed successfully.

## üéØ Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- I'll help you list the pods in your infrastructure. Since you didn't specify a namespace, I'll check the 'production' namespace first. Let me do that for you.

```
kubectl get pods -n production
```

Let me retrieve that information for you.

I'll use the get_pod_status tool to list the pods in the production namespace:

```
get_pod_status --namespace production
```

Let me run this command to get the pod information.

## üìã Next Steps

3. Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent will examine node status to verify infrastructure health using get_node_status tool
