# üîç Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

The investigation results don't contain enough information to generate a meaningful executive summary. The agent attempted to list pods in the production namespace using `kubectl get pods -n production` and mentioned using a `get_pod_status` tool, but no actual results from these commands were provided in the investigation.

Without seeing the output of these commands, I cannot determine:
- If there are any pods running
- The status of any pods
- Any potential issues with the infrastructure
- Any performance metrics or error conditions

To generate an executive summary, I would need the actual output showing pod statuses, any error messages, or performance indicators from the investigation.

## üéØ Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- I'll help you list the pods in your infrastructure. Since you didn't specify a namespace, I'll check the 'production' namespace first. Let me know if you'd like to see pods in a different namespace.

```
kubectl get pods -n production
```

Let me retrieve that information for you.

I'll use the get_pod_status tool to check what pods are running in the production namespace:

## üìã Next Steps

3. Provide a summary of pod count by namespace and status
