# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** what is the status of my database pod.
**Status:** Step 3 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Investigation incomplete - agents were unable to retrieve database pod status information
- **Impact**: Unable to determine - insufficient data from investigation
- **Severity**: Unable to assess - investigation did not yield conclusive results

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Rerun investigation with specific database pod name (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Use Infrastructure Agent with proper kubectl commands to check pod status directly
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement monitoring dashboard for database pod health visibility
4. **Follow-up**: Ensure proper access permissions for agents to query Kubernetes resources

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- No critical alerts identified as investigation was inconclusive

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- I'll check the status of database pods in the production namespace for you. Let me look that up.

```
Checking for database pods in the production namespace...
```

Let me use the get_pod_status tool to find and check database pods in the production namespace.

I'll search for pods with "database" in their name.

### Application Logs Agent
- I'll help you check the status of your database pod by examining the relevant logs. Let me search for database-related logs to get information about its status.

To properly investigate this, I need to search for logs related to database pods. Let me do that for you.

```python
search_logs(query="database pod status", time_range="1h", limit=5)
```

I need to be more specific in my search to find relevant database pod logs. Let me try a different query:

```python
search_logs(query="database pod", time_range="1h", limit=5)
```

Based on the available tools, I don't have direct access to pod status information through logs alone. The logs search tools I have access to can show application logs, but not the actual pod status.

To get the status of your database pod, I recommend:

1. Using the Infrastructure Agent who can run commands like `kubectl get pods` to check pod status directly
2. Specifying which database pod you're interested in (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.) for more targeted assistance

Would you like me to search for any specific error logs related to your database that might indicate issues? Or would you prefer to contact the Infrastructure Agent for direct pod status information?

## ✅ Investigation Complete

All planned investigation steps have been executed.
