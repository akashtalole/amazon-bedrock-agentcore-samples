# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** my api response time have degraded in the last 3 hours
**Status:** Step 3 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database configuration failures (missing ConfigMap 'database-config', permission issues on data directory) triggered a cascade of connection timeouts and memory exhaustion in the web-service
- **Impact**: Severe performance degradation with API response times increasing from 150ms to 5000ms (5 seconds)
- **Severity**: High - Web-service experiencing memory exhaustion (100% utilization), database connection failures, and 75% error rate

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Fix the missing database ConfigMap in production namespace and correct PostgreSQL data directory permissions
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Increase memory allocation for web-service to address OutOfMemoryError and implement proper connection pool handling
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Optimize slow database queries, particularly "SELECT * FROM users WHERE status='active'"
4. **Follow-up**: Implement monitoring for database connection timeouts and memory usage in web-service

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Web-service experiencing OutOfMemoryError causing application shutdowns
- Database pod failing liveness probes due to configuration issues
- CPU utilization at 95% and memory at 100%, causing service instability

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Performance Metrics Agent
- ## Summary of API Response Time Degradation

Based on the metrics data collected, I can confirm there has been a significant degradation in API response times over the last 3 hours. Here's what the data shows:

### Response Time Degradation
According to the `get_performance_metrics` data, the web-service API response times have dramatically increased:
- Starting at 150ms (14:20:00Z)
- Rapidly increasing to 5000ms (5 seconds) by 14:24:00Z
- P95 response time increased from 200ms to 5000ms

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Resource Exhaustion**:
   - CPU usage: Increased from 25% to 95% (source: `get_resource_metrics`)
   - Memory usage: Reached 100% utilization, growing from 512MB (50%) to 1024MB (100%) (source: `get_resource_metrics`)

2. **Error Rate Spike**:
   - Error rate increased from 0.5% to 75% (source: `get_error_rates`)
   - Server errors (5xx) dramatically increased from 5 to 148 (source: `get_error_rates`)
   - Sample count decreased from 100 to 20, indicating reduced throughput (source: `get_performance_metrics`)

3. **Database Issues**:
   - The database service is showing 100% error rate with "connection_refused" errors (source: `get_error_rates`)
   - Database failures due to "ConfigMap not found" and "Permission denied on data directory" (source: `get_error_rates`)

4. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - The `analyze_trends` tool confirms anomalous behavior with response times deviating up to 100% from normal patterns
   - The trend is clearly "increasing" with an average value of 2500ms and standard deviation of 1200ms

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Investigate and resolve the database connection issues - this appears to be a primary cause
   - Check the missing ConfigMap and permission issues on the database pod
   - Consider scaling up the web-service to handle the load (both CPU and memory are at capacity)

2. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Increase memory limits for the web-service as it's reached 100% utilization
   - Add more CPU resources as utilization has reached 95%

3. **Error Investigation**:
   - Examine the server errors (5xx) which increased from 5 to 148
   - Focus on the database connectivity issues which may be causing cascading failures

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Continue monitoring response times after implementing fixes
   - Set up alerts for early detection of similar degradation patterns

The data clearly shows a correlation between resource exhaustion, database connectivity issues, and the API response time degradation. Addressing these issues should restore normal service performance.

### Application Logs Agent
- ## API Response Time Degradation Analysis

Based on the log data collected, I've identified several critical issues that are causing the API response time degradation over the last 3 hours:

### 1. Database Connection Issues

According to the `get_error_logs` data, there are multiple database connection problems:
- Database connection timeouts started at 14:23:46Z with errors like: "Database connection timeout after 5000ms" 
- The database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) is experiencing critical failures:
  - Missing configuration file: "could not open configuration file '/etc/postgresql/database.conf'" at 14:22:30Z
  - Permission issues: "data directory '/var/lib/postgresql/data' has invalid permissions" at 14:23:00Z
  - Missing ConfigMap: "ConfigMap 'database-config' not found in namespace 'production'" at 14:23:30Z
  - Failed liveness probe: "Container postgres failed liveness probe" at 14:24:30Z

### 2. Memory Issues in Web Service

Based on `get_error_logs` output, the web-service is experiencing memory exhaustion:
- OutOfMemoryError occurred at 14:24:30Z: "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space"
- This led to application shutdown: "Application shutting down due to critical error" at 14:25:11Z
- The pattern analysis from `analyze_log_patterns` shows 8 occurrences of OutOfMemoryError

### 3. Slow Database Queries

The `analyze_log_patterns` tool identified a pattern of slow database queries:
- 25 occurrences of "Slow query detected" between 14:22:15Z and 14:23:45Z
- Example: "Slow query detected: SELECT * FROM users WHERE status='active' - Duration: 1250ms"

### 4. Error Distribution

According to `count_log_events`, the error distribution shows:
- 77.8% of errors are from web-service (35 errors)
- 17.8% from api-service (8 errors)
- 4.4% from database-service (2 errors)

## Root Cause Analysis

The sequence of events suggests the following chain of failures:

1. **Initial Trigger**: Database configuration issues started around 14:22:30Z (missing config file, permissions problems)
2. **Cascading Effect**: These database issues led to connection timeouts in the web-service
3. **Performance Degradation**: Slow queries began appearing (25 occurrences)
4. **Resource Exhaustion**: The web-service started experiencing memory issues, likely due to connection pooling problems or retry mechanisms
5. **Critical Failure**: Eventually, the web-service ran out of memory and began shutting down at 14:25:11Z

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Fix the database ConfigMap issue: Ensure 'database-config' exists in the production namespace
   - Correct the permissions on the PostgreSQL data directory
   - Restart the database pod with proper configuration

2. **Web Service Recovery**:
   - Increase the Java heap space allocation for the web-service
   - Implement proper connection pool handling with timeouts and circuit breakers
   - Review the code in UserService.loadAllUsers() which is causing memory issues

3. **Query Optimization**:
   - Optimize the slow queries, particularly the SELECT query on the users table
   - Consider adding appropriate indexes

4. **Monitoring Improvements**:
   - Set up alerts for database connection timeouts
   - Monitor memory usage in the web-service more proactively
   - Add specific monitoring for query performance

By addressing these issues, particularly the database configuration problems and memory allocation for the web-service, you should be able to resolve the API response time degradation.
