# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** what is the status of my database pod.
**Status:** Step 3 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Missing ConfigMap "database-config" in production namespace, specifically the required key "config/database.conf" (confirmed by both agents)
- **Impact**: Database service outage affecting Web and API services
- **Severity**: High - Database pod in CrashLoopBackOff state with dependent services returning 503 errors

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Create or update the ConfigMap "database-config" with the required "config/database.conf" key
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Fix permissions on '/var/lib/postgresql/data' directory which are currently invalid
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement monitoring for ConfigMap existence and validity to prevent similar outages
4. **Follow-up**: Review PreStop hook configuration that's failing with exit status 1

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Web Service has activated circuit breaker for database connections
- API Service endpoints are returning 503 Service Unavailable responses
- Database has been unavailable for over 120 seconds

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- ## Database Pod Status

Based on the results from `get_pod_status` tool, I found a database pod named **database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q** in the production namespace. This pod is currently in a **CrashLoopBackOff** state (source: get_pod_status).

### Current Status Details:
- **Pod Name**: database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q
- **Namespace**: production
- **Status**: CrashLoopBackOff
- **Phase**: Failed
- **Node**: node-2
- **Created at**: 2024-01-15T09:15:00Z
- **Resource Usage**: CPU: 0, Memory: 0 (0% utilization)

### Issue Details:
According to `get_cluster_events` tool, there are two warning events related to this database pod:

1. **Configuration Error**: "Error: couldn't find key config/database.conf in ConfigMap production/database-config" (source: get_cluster_events)
   - This occurred at 2024-01-15T14:23:00Z
   - Count: 15 occurrences

2. **PreStop Hook Failure**: "PreStopHook failed: exec [/bin/sh -c pg_ctl stop -D /var/lib/postgresql/data -m fast] failed: exit status 1" (source: get_cluster_events)
   - This occurred at 2024-01-15T14:22:30Z
   - Count: 12 occurrences

### Recommendation:
The database pod is failing because it cannot find a required configuration file in the ConfigMap. To resolve this issue:

1. Check if the ConfigMap "database-config" exists in the production namespace
2. Verify that the ConfigMap contains the required key "config/database.conf"
3. If missing, create or update the ConfigMap with the necessary configuration

Would you like me to help you investigate further or provide guidance on fixing the ConfigMap issue?

### Application Logs Agent
- ## Database Pod Status Report

Based on the log analysis, I can provide the following information about your database pod:

### Pod Identification
According to the logs, your database pod is identified as **database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q** in the production namespace (source: logs-api___get_error_logs).

### Current Status
The database pod is currently **failing** and appears to be in a crash loop. According to the error logs, the pod is experiencing multiple critical issues that are preventing it from starting properly (source: logs-api___get_error_logs).

### Specific Issues Identified

1. **Configuration File Missing**:
   - Error: "FATAL: could not open configuration file '/etc/postgresql/database.conf': No such file or directory" (timestamp: 2024-01-15T14:22:30.123Z, source: logs-api___get_error_logs)
   - Error: "ERROR: ConfigMap 'database-config' not found in namespace 'production'" (timestamp: 2024-01-15T14:23:30.012Z, source: logs-api___get_error_logs)

2. **Permission Issues**:
   - Error: "FATAL: data directory '/var/lib/postgresql/data' has invalid permissions" (timestamp: 2024-01-15T14:23:00.789Z, source: logs-api___get_error_logs)
   - Details: "Permission denied: data directory must be owned by the postgres user"

3. **Health Check Failures**:
   - Error: "Container postgres failed liveness probe, will be restarted" (timestamp: 2024-01-15T14:24:30.345Z, source: logs-api___get_error_logs)
   - Probe result: "connection refused on port 5432"

### Impact on Dependent Services

Multiple services are affected by the database outage:

1. **Web Service**:
   - "Database connection timeout after 5000ms" (timestamp: 2024-01-15T14:23:46.567Z, source: logs-api___search_logs)
   - "Circuit breaker activated for database service" (timestamp: 2024-01-15T14:24:00.123Z, source: logs-api___search_logs)
   - "Database has been unavailable for 120 seconds" (timestamp: 2024-01-15T14:24:00.999Z, source: logs-api___search_logs)

2. **API Service**:
   - "Failed to connect to database: Connection refused" (timestamp: 2024-01-15T14:22:00.111Z, source: logs-api___search_logs)
   - "All database-dependent endpoints returning 503 Service Unavailable" (timestamp: 2024-01-15T14:25:00.222Z, source: logs-api___search_logs)

### Recommended Actions

Based on the log analysis, I recommend:

1. Create or fix the missing ConfigMap 'database-config' in the production namespace
2. Check and correct the permissions on the '/var/lib/postgresql/data' directory
3. Verify the PostgreSQL configuration is correctly mounted in the pod
4. Restart the database pod after fixing these issues

Would you like me to provide more details on any specific aspect of the database pod issues?
