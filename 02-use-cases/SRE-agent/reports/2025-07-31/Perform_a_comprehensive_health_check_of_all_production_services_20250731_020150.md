# üîç Investigation Results

**Query:** yes
**Status:** Step 3 of 3 Complete

## üìã Executive Summary

### üéØ Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Missing ConfigMap 'database-config' in production namespace, specifically the required key "config/database.conf" preventing database pod startup
- **Impact**: Service degradation across multiple components - database service completely down (0/1 replicas), web application partially degraded (2/3 replicas available)
- **Severity**: High - Database service completely unavailable with cascading failures affecting dependent services

### ‚ö° Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Create or restore the missing ConfigMap 'database-config' with the required "config/database.conf" key
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Address memory pressure on node-3 (>85% usage) and investigate web service OutOfMemoryErrors
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Optimize slow database queries (25 occurrences of "Slow query detected") and implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
4. **Follow-up**: Review memory allocation for web service pods and monitor node-1 which is approaching resource limits

### üö® Critical Alerts
- Database pod in CrashLoopBackOff state due to missing configuration
- Web service experiencing OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space errors (8 occurrences)
- Node-3 under memory pressure condition (>85% memory usage)

## üéØ Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- # Production Services Health Check Report

## Summary of Findings

Based on my comprehensive health check of the production namespace, I've identified several issues that require attention:

### Critical Issues:
1. **Database Service Failure**: According to `get_deployment_status` output, the database-deployment is in a Failed state with 0/1 available replicas.
2. **Web Application Degradation**: Based on `get_deployment_status` results, the web-app-deployment is in a Degraded state with 2/3 available replicas.
3. **Node Memory Pressure**: According to `get_node_status` data, node-3 is experiencing memory pressure (above 85% usage).

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Deployment Status
- **Healthy Services**: 
  - API Service: 5/5 replicas available (source: `get_deployment_status`)

- **Degraded Services**:
  - Web App: 2/3 replicas available (source: `get_deployment_status`)

- **Failed Services**:
  - Database: 0/1 replicas available (source: `get_deployment_status`)

### 2. Pod Status
- **Database Pod Issue**: 
  - Pod `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q` is in CrashLoopBackOff state (source: `get_pod_status`)
  - Root cause: Missing ConfigMap key "config/database.conf" (source: `get_cluster_events`)
  - Additional issue: PreStopHook failures during pod termination (source: `get_cluster_events`)

- **Web App Pod Issue**:
  - Readiness probe failures with HTTP 503 responses (source: `get_cluster_events`)
  - High resource utilization: 75% CPU, 85% memory (source: `get_pod_status`)

### 3. Node Status
- All nodes are in "Ready" state (source: `get_node_status`)
- **Resource Concerns**:
  - Node-1: High usage (2.5/3.5 CPU, 6/7Gi memory) (source: `get_node_status`)
  - Node-3: Memory pressure condition (>85% memory usage) (source: `get_node_status`)

### 4. Resource Usage
- Production namespace is using 4.5 CPU cores (source: `get_resource_usage`)
- Production namespace is using 10Gi memory (source: `get_resource_usage`)

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Database ConfigMap Issue**:
   - Verify the existence of ConfigMap "database-config" in production namespace
   - Ensure it contains the required key "config/database.conf"

2. **Address Web App Health**:
   - Investigate HTTP 503 errors causing readiness probe failures
   - Consider scaling up resources or optimizing the application to reduce high memory usage

3. **Resolve Node Memory Pressure**:
   - Redistribute workloads from node-3 to node-2 which has lower utilization
   - Consider adding additional nodes if overall cluster capacity is insufficient

4. **Monitor Resource Usage**:
   - Keep an eye on node-1 which is approaching resource limits
   - Review memory allocation for pods to prevent further memory pressure issues

Would you like me to provide more details on any specific issue or help with implementing any of these recommendations?

### Application Logs Agent
- # Application Logs Analysis Report

## Summary of Log Findings

Based on my analysis of the application logs, I've identified several critical issues that align with and provide deeper context to the Kubernetes issues previously identified:

### Critical Issues Identified in Logs:

1. **Database Configuration Failure**
   - According to `get_error_logs` output, the database pod is failing due to missing configuration file: "FATAL: could not open configuration file '/etc/postgresql/database.conf': No such file or directory"
   - Additional error: "ERROR: ConfigMap 'database-config' not found in namespace 'production'" (source: `get_error_logs`)

2. **Web Service Database Connection Issues**
   - According to `analyze_log_patterns` tool, there are 15 occurrences of "Database connection timeout" errors
   - Web service logs show "Database health check failed: no response from database-pod" (source: `get_recent_logs`)

3. **Memory Issues in Web Service**
   - According to `get_error_logs` data, multiple "OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space" errors in web-service
   - Pattern analysis shows 8 occurrences of OutOfMemoryError (source: `analyze_log_patterns`)
   - Web service ultimately shut down due to these memory issues (source: `get_recent_logs`)

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Database Service Issues

The database pod is failing to start due to multiple configuration issues:
- Missing configuration file at '/etc/postgresql/database.conf' (source: `get_error_logs`)
- Missing ConfigMap 'database-config' in production namespace (source: `get_error_logs`)
- Data directory permission issues: "data directory '/var/lib/postgresql/data' has invalid permissions" (source: `get_error_logs`)
- Failed liveness probe: "connection refused on port 5432" (source: `get_error_logs`)

### 2. Web Service Issues

The web service is experiencing cascading failures due to:
- Database connectivity issues: "Database connection timeout after 5000ms" (source: `get_error_logs`)
- Memory exhaustion: "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space" (source: `get_error_logs`)
- The service attempted to switch to "cache-only mode" but ultimately failed (source: `get_recent_logs`)
- Application shutdown due to critical errors (source: `get_recent_logs`)

### 3. Performance Issues

- 25 occurrences of "Slow query detected" warnings (source: `analyze_log_patterns`)
- Example slow query: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE status='active' - Duration: 1250ms" (source: `analyze_log_patterns`)

### 4. Error Distribution

- Web service accounts for 77.8% of all errors (35 errors) (source: `count_log_events`)
- API service accounts for 17.8% of errors (8 errors) (source: `count_log_events`)
- Database service accounts for 4.4% of errors (2 errors) (source: `count_log_events`)

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on the log analysis, the primary root causes are:

1. **Missing ConfigMap for Database**: The database pod cannot start because the required ConfigMap 'database-config' is missing or doesn't contain the expected configuration.

2. **Memory Resource Constraints**: The web service is experiencing OutOfMemoryError issues, likely due to insufficient memory allocation or a memory leak.

3. **Cascading Failure Pattern**: The database failure is causing connection timeouts in the web service, which is then triggering additional errors and ultimately leading to service degradation.

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Database Configuration**:
   - Create or update the ConfigMap 'database-config' in the production namespace with the required configuration
   - Ensure proper permissions are set on the PostgreSQL data directory

2. **Address Memory Issues**:
   - Increase memory allocation for the web service pods
   - Investigate potential memory leaks in the UserService.loadAllUsers method (source: `get_error_logs`)
   - Consider implementing pagination for bulk operations to reduce memory consumption

3. **Optimize Database Queries**:
   - Review and optimize the slow queries identified in the logs
   - Add appropriate indexes to improve query performance

4. **Implement Circuit Breakers**:
   - Add proper circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures when the database is unavailable

Would you like me to provide more specific details on any of these issues or help with implementing the recommendations?
