# ðŸ“‹ Investigation Plan

**Query:** Perform a comprehensive health check of all production services.
**Complexity:** Complex

## Investigation Steps

1. Check the status of all production pods and deployments to identify any failing or degraded services
2. Analyze performance metrics for all production services to identify any performance issues or resource constraints
3. Review recent error logs for any critical or warning messages across production services
4. Check cluster events for any recent infrastructure issues that might affect service health

## Plan Details

**Reasoning:** A comprehensive health check requires examining multiple aspects of the system: infrastructure status (Kubernetes), performance metrics, and application logs. This multi-domain investigation will provide a complete picture of production health by checking for failing pods, resource constraints, performance issues, and error patterns. Based on the user's preferences for detailed investigations with automated diagnostic tools and executive summary reporting, this plan will gather all necessary data for a thorough health assessment.
**Auto-execute:** No

## Available Actions
