# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** What is the status of my cluster?
**Status:** Investigation Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent timeout - investigation tooling unable to complete cluster status check within 300 seconds
- **Impact**: **Unable to determine cluster status** - investigation inconclusive due to agent failure
- **Severity**: **High** - Critical monitoring capability compromised, preventing assessment of potential cluster issues

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Manually verify cluster status using direct kubectl commands and monitoring dashboards
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Investigate agent timeout root cause - check for API server responsiveness, network connectivity, or resource constraints
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement agent timeout handling and fallback monitoring mechanisms
4. **Follow-up**: Review agent performance metrics and establish timeout thresholds for different investigation types

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- **Investigation tooling failure**: Primary cluster monitoring agent non-functional - manual verification required immediately
- **Blind spot risk**: Cannot confirm cluster health status through automated investigation tools

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- Agent execution timed out after 300 seconds. The agent may be stuck on a tool call or LLM response.

## ✅ Investigation Complete

All planned investigation steps have been executed.
