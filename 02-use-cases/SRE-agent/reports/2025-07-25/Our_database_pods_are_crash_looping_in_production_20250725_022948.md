# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** Our database pods are crash looping in production
**Status:** Investigation Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Unable to determine - both investigation agents failed to complete their analysis
- **Impact**: Unable to verify - investigation tools timed out or encountered errors
- **Severity**: Unable to assess - insufficient data from failed investigation tools

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Manually investigate database pod crash loops in production environment
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Troubleshoot and fix the SRE investigation tools that failed
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement more robust investigation tooling with proper error handling
4. **Follow-up**: Review and improve timeout settings for Application Logs Agent

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Investigation tools failed: Application Logs Agent timed out after 60 seconds
- Operational Runbooks Agent encountered an error with tool calls not having corresponding responses

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Application Logs Agent
- Agent execution timed out after 60 seconds. The agent may be stuck on a tool call or LLM response.

### Operational Runbooks Agent
- Agent execution failed: Found AIMessages with tool_calls that do not have a corresponding ToolMessage. Here are the first few of those tool calls: [{'name': 'logs-api___search_logs', 'args': {'pattern': 'database-pod'}, 'id': 'toolu_bdrk_01SNPw64FJK6wPtN4mGFQEXS', 'type': 'tool_call'}].

Every tool call (LLM requesting to call a tool) in the message history MUST have a corresponding ToolMessage (result of a tool invocation to return to the LLM) - this is required by most LLM providers.

## ✅ Investigation Complete

All planned investigation steps have been executed.
