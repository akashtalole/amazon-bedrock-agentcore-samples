# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** Our database pods are crash looping in production
**Status:** Investigation Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Investigation incomplete - operational runbooks analysis timed out after 60 seconds
- **Impact**: Unable to assess impact due to incomplete investigation
- **Severity**: **Unknown** - requires immediate manual investigation to determine actual system state

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Manually verify database pod status using `kubectl get pods` and check crash logs
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Complete manual runbook execution for database crash loop scenarios
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Review investigation tooling timeout configurations
4. **Follow-up**: Re-run automated investigation once manual assessment is complete

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- **Investigation tooling failure**: Automated analysis unable to complete - manual intervention required immediately
- **Potential service impact**: Database crash loops reported but impact assessment pending manual verification

## 🎯 Key Findings
