# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** Our database pods are crash looping in production
**Status:** Investigation Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Investigation system failure - monitoring and diagnostic agents are non-functional
- **Impact**: **Critical blind spot** - Unable to assess actual database pod status or crash loop severity
- **Severity**: **Critical** - Complete loss of observability during a reported production database incident

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): 
   - Manually check database pod status via kubectl/direct cluster access
   - Bypass failed monitoring agents and use direct diagnostic tools
   - Escalate to platform team to restore investigation tooling
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): 
   - Fix agent timeout and tool integration issues
   - Establish backup diagnostic procedures for monitoring system failures
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): 
   - Implement redundant monitoring pathways
   - Add health checks for investigation agents
4. **Follow-up**: Review incident response procedures when primary tooling fails

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- **INVESTIGATION SYSTEM DOWN**: Primary diagnostic agents are failing, creating dangerous blind spot during production database incident
- **MANUAL INTERVENTION REQUIRED**: Direct cluster access needed immediately to assess actual database pod health
- **ESCALATION NEEDED**: Platform/SRE tooling team must restore monitoring capabilities urgently

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Application Logs Agent
- Agent execution timed out after 60 seconds. The agent may be stuck on a tool call or LLM response.

### Operational Runbooks Agent
- Agent execution failed: Found AIMessages with tool_calls that do not have a corresponding ToolMessage. Here are the first few of those tool calls: [{'name': 'logs-api___get_recent_logs', 'args': {'limit': 10}, 'id': 'toolu_bdrk_01ErSzXw7JX3AhoT9qSKCddx', 'type': 'tool_call'}].

Every tool call (LLM requesting to call a tool) in the message history MUST have a corresponding ToolMessage (result of a tool invocation to return to the LLM) - this is required by most LLM providers.

## ✅ Investigation Complete

All planned investigation steps have been executed.
