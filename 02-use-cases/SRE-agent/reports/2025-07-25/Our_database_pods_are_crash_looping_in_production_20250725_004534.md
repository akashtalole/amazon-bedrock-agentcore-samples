# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** Our database pods are crash looping in production
**Status:** Investigation Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Investigation system failure - all diagnostic agents failed to execute due to technical issues
- **Impact**: **Unable to assess** - No data collected on reported database pod crash looping
- **Severity**: **Unknown** - Cannot determine severity without investigation results

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Fix investigation tooling issues and re-run diagnostic agents to assess database pod status
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Manually investigate database pod crash looping using kubectl commands and log analysis
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Review and fix SRE investigation agent configuration and tool integration
4. **Follow-up**: Establish backup manual investigation procedures for when automated tools fail

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- **Investigation Blind Spot**: All automated diagnostic agents failed - manual intervention required immediately to assess production database status
- **Potential Service Risk**: Database pods reportedly crash looping but impact unknown due to investigation failure

**Note**: This summary reflects investigation system failures, not the actual database issue. Immediate manual assessment of production database pods is required.

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- Agent execution timed out after 30 seconds. The agent may be stuck on a tool call or LLM response.

### Application Logs Agent
- Agent execution failed: Found AIMessages with tool_calls that do not have a corresponding ToolMessage. Here are the first few of those tool calls: [{'name': 'k8s-api___get_pod_status', 'args': {'namespace': 'production', 'pod_name': 'database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q'}, 'id': 'toolu_bdrk_011hvCjzLPkVyLFzRcv3CER9', 'type': 'tool_call'}].

Every tool call (LLM requesting to call a tool) in the message history MUST have a corresponding ToolMessage (result of a tool invocation to return to the LLM) - this is required by most LLM providers.
