# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** Our database pods are crash looping in production
**Status:** Investigation Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Missing ConfigMap key "config/database.conf" in the database-config ConfigMap and permission issues with the PostgreSQL data directory
- **Impact**: Complete database outage affecting web-service and api-service
- **Severity**: Critical - database pods are in CrashLoopBackOff state with 0/1 available replicas, causing cascading failures in dependent services

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Create the missing ConfigMap with required database configuration
   ```bash
   kubectl create configmap database-config --from-file=config/database.conf=/path/to/database.conf -n production
   ```
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Fix permission issues for the PostgreSQL data directory
   ```bash
   kubectl edit deployment database-deployment -n production
   # Add securityContext with fsGroup: 999, runAsUser: 999
   ```
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement ConfigMap validation in CI/CD pipeline and add monitoring for ConfigMap existence
4. **Follow-up**: Document configuration requirements and review PreStop hook implementation that's failing during pod termination

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Database outage is causing 15 "Database connection timeout" errors in web-service
- 8 "OutOfMemoryError" occurrences in web-service related to connection pooling issues
- All users are affected by this outage according to the incident runbook

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- ## Database Pod Crash Loop Analysis

Based on my investigation, I can confirm that your database pods are indeed crash looping in the production namespace. Here's what I've found:

### Current Status
According to `get_pod_status` output, pod `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q` in the production namespace is in **CrashLoopBackOff** state.

### Deployment Status
Based on `get_deployment_status` tool results, the `database-deployment` in production has 0/1 available replicas and is in a **Failed** status.

### Root Cause
According to `get_cluster_events` data, there are two critical issues causing the crash loops:

1. **Missing ConfigMap Key**: 
   - Error message: "couldn't find key config/database.conf in ConfigMap production/database-config"
   - This event has occurred 15 times (source: get_cluster_events)

2. **Failed PreStop Hook**:
   - Error message: "PreStopHook failed: exec [/bin/sh -c pg_ctl stop -D /var/lib/postgresql/data -m fast] failed: exit status 1"
   - This event has occurred 12 times (source: get_cluster_events)

### Recommended Actions

1. **Fix the ConfigMap issue**:
   ```bash
   # Check the current ConfigMap
   kubectl get configmap database-config -n production -o yaml
   
   # Create or update the ConfigMap with the required key
   kubectl create configmap database-config --from-file=config/database.conf=/path/to/database.conf -n production --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
   ```

2. **Investigate the PreStop Hook failure**:
   - The database may not be shutting down properly
   - Check if the PostgreSQL data directory exists and has proper permissions
   - Verify that the pg_ctl command is available in the container

3. **Restart the deployment after fixes**:
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout restart deployment database-deployment -n production
   ```

### Application Logs Agent
- ## Database Pod Crash Loop Analysis

Based on my investigation of the application logs, I've identified several critical issues causing your database pods to crash loop in production.

### Root Causes Identified

According to `get_error_logs` output, there are multiple issues affecting the database pod `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q`:

1. **Missing Configuration File**:
   - Error log from 2024-01-15T14:22:30.123Z: "FATAL: could not open configuration file '/etc/postgresql/database.conf': No such file or directory" (source: get_error_logs)
   - Error log from 2024-01-15T14:22:31.456Z: "PostgreSQL init process failed: missing required configuration" (source: get_error_logs)

2. **ConfigMap Issue**:
   - Error log from 2024-01-15T14:23:30.012Z: "ERROR: ConfigMap 'database-config' not found in namespace 'production'" (source: get_error_logs)

3. **Permission Problems**:
   - Error log from 2024-01-15T14:23:00.789Z: "FATAL: data directory '/var/lib/postgresql/data' has invalid permissions" with details "Permission denied: data directory must be owned by the postgres user" (source: get_error_logs)

4. **Failed Health Checks**:
   - Error log from 2024-01-15T14:24:30.345Z: "Container postgres failed liveness probe, will be restarted" with probe result "connection refused on port 5432" (source: get_error_logs)

### Impact on Other Services

According to `analyze_log_patterns` tool, these database issues are causing cascading failures:

- 15 occurrences of "Database connection timeout" errors in web-service (source: analyze_log_patterns)
- 8 occurrences of "OutOfMemoryError" in web-service, possibly related to connection pooling issues (source: analyze_log_patterns)
- 25 occurrences of "Slow query detected" warnings before the database completely failed (source: analyze_log_patterns)

### Recommended Actions

1. **Fix the ConfigMap issue**:
   ```bash
   # Create the missing ConfigMap
   kubectl create configmap database-config --from-file=database.conf=/path/to/your/database.conf -n production
   ```

2. **Fix the permissions issue**:
   ```bash
   # Update the security context in your database deployment
   kubectl edit deployment database-deployment -n production
   ```
   Add or modify the securityContext section to ensure proper permissions:
   ```yaml
   securityContext:
     fsGroup: 999  # postgres group ID
     runAsUser: 999  # postgres user ID
   ```

3. **Verify volume mounts**:
   Ensure your database configuration is properly mounted:
   ```yaml
   volumeMounts:
   - name: config-volume
     mountPath: /etc/postgresql/
   volumes:
   - name: config-volume
     configMap:
       name: database-config
   ```

4. **Restart the deployment**:
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout restart deployment database-deployment -n production
   ```

5. **Monitor the restart**:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -f deployment/database-deployment -n production
   ```
