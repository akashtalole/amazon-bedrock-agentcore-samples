# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** what is the status of my database pod
**Status:** Investigation Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod failing due to missing ConfigMap `database-config` in production namespace and permission issues on PostgreSQL data directory
- **Impact**: Service outage - Database pod `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q` completely non-operational with 0% availability for over 5 hours
- **Severity**: Critical - Database pod in CrashLoopBackOff state with 15 restarts, causing web-service connection timeouts

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Create the missing ConfigMap `database-config` with required key `config/database.conf` in production namespace
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Fix permissions on `/var/lib/postgresql/data` directory to be owned by postgres user
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement configuration validation checks in CI/CD pipeline to prevent missing ConfigMaps
4. **Follow-up**: Review PostgreSQL shutdown procedures to address PreStopHook failures

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Web-service experiencing 15 database connection timeout errors due to database unavailability
- Database pod has been down for approximately 5 hours with 0% availability
- All health checks failing (0 successful out of 1442 attempts)

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- ## Database Pod Status Report

Based on my investigation, I've found your database pod in the production namespace.

**Current Status:** According to `get_pod_status` tool, the database pod `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q` is currently in a **CrashLoopBackOff** state with phase **Failed** on node-2.

**Root Cause:** Based on `get_cluster_events` data, there are two critical issues affecting this pod:

1. **Configuration Error:** "Error: couldn't find key config/database.conf in ConfigMap production/database-config" (15 occurrences)
2. **Shutdown Issue:** "PreStopHook failed: exec [/bin/sh -c pg_ctl stop -D /var/lib/postgresql/data -m fast] failed: exit status 1" (12 occurrences)

**Resource Usage:** According to `get_pod_status` tool, the pod is currently not consuming any resources (CPU: 0, Memory: 0) as it's in a failed state.

**Recommendation:** The primary issue appears to be a missing configuration file in your ConfigMap. You should:
1. Verify that the ConfigMap `database-config` exists in the production namespace
2. Ensure it contains the required key `config/database.conf`
3. Check if the PostgreSQL data directory is properly configured

### Application Logs Agent
- ## Database Pod Status Report

Based on my analysis of the application logs, I can provide the following information about your database pod:

**Current Status:** According to the error logs, the database pod `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q` in the production namespace is experiencing critical issues that are preventing it from starting properly.

**Root Causes:** Based on `get_error_logs` data, there are several issues affecting the database pod:

1. **Missing Configuration File:**
   - Error log from 2024-01-15T14:22:30.123Z: "FATAL: could not open configuration file '/etc/postgresql/database.conf': No such file or directory"
   - Error log from 2024-01-15T14:23:30.012Z: "ERROR: ConfigMap 'database-config' not found in namespace 'production'"

2. **Permission Issues:**
   - Error log from 2024-01-15T14:23:00.789Z: "FATAL: data directory '/var/lib/postgresql/data' has invalid permissions"
   - Details: "Permission denied: data directory must be owned by the postgres user"

3. **Liveness Probe Failures:**
   - Error log from 2024-01-15T14:24:30.345Z: "Container postgres failed liveness probe, will be restarted"
   - Probe result: "connection refused on port 5432"

**Impact on Other Services:** According to `analyze_log_patterns` tool, there are 15 database connection timeout errors from web-service, indicating that the database unavailability is affecting dependent services.

**Recommendations:**
1. Create the missing ConfigMap 'database-config' in the production namespace
2. Fix the permissions on the PostgreSQL data directory
3. Verify the database configuration is correctly mounted to '/etc/postgresql/database.conf'
4. Check if the PostgreSQL service is properly configured to listen on port 5432

### Performance Metrics Agent
- ## Database Pod Status Report

Based on the performance metrics data I've gathered, I can provide the following assessment of your database pod:

**Current Status: CRITICAL - Not Operational**

According to the `get_availability_metrics` tool, the database pod `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q` is currently in a **critical** state with **0% availability**. The pod has been down since 2024-01-15T09:15:00Z (over 5 hours).

**Key Findings:**

1. **Zero Availability:** 
   - Availability percentage: 0.0% (source: get_availability_metrics)
   - All health checks are failing (0 successful out of 1442 attempts)

2. **Continuous Restarts:**
   - Restart count: 15 (source: get_availability_metrics)
   - The pod has been continuously restarting without successfully coming online

3. **Error Patterns:**
   - Connection refused errors: 1442 instances (source: get_error_rates)
   - Startup failures: 15 instances (source: get_error_rates)

4. **Root Causes Identified:**
   - "ConfigMap not found" (source: get_error_rates)
   - "Permission denied on data directory" (source: get_error_rates)

5. **No Performance Data Available:**
   - No CPU, memory, or response time metrics are available (source: get_resource_metrics, get_performance_metrics)
   - This is consistent with a pod that cannot start successfully

**Downtime Duration:**
- The database has been down for approximately 5 hours and 7 minutes (18,420 seconds) as of the last metric timestamp (source: get_availability_metrics)

**Recommendation:**
Based on the metrics data, the database pod is failing to start due to configuration and permission issues. You should:

1. Verify the required ConfigMap exists and is properly configured
2. Check and fix permissions on the database data directory
3. Review the pod's configuration for any other startup issues
