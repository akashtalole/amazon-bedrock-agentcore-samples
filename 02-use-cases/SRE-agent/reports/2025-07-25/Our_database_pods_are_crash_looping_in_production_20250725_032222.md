**Query:** Our database pods are crash looping in production
**Status:** Investigation Complete

I notice that no investigation results were provided in your request. Without specific investigation data about the database pods crash looping in production, I cannot generate an accurate executive summary.

To provide a helpful executive summary, I would need information such as:
- Which database pods are affected
- Error logs or crash reports
- Resource utilization metrics
- Recent changes or deployments
- Impact on dependent services
- Current status of the pods

Please share the investigation results so I can generate a proper executive summary that accurately reflects the situation.
