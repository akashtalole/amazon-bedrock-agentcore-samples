# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** Our database pods are crash looping in production
**Status:** Investigation Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: **Investigation incomplete** - Operational runbook analysis timed out after 30 seconds, preventing root cause identification
- **Impact**: **Unknown severity** - Database pod crash looping reported but investigation failed to complete
- **Severity**: **Critical** - Database crash looping typically indicates service failure, but severity cannot be confirmed without completed investigation

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Manually investigate database pod status and logs to assess current service state
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Re-run investigation tools with extended timeout or manual analysis to identify crash loop cause
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Review investigation tooling performance and timeout configurations
4. **Follow-up**: Implement monitoring alerts for investigation tool failures during critical incidents

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- **Investigation tooling failure**: Primary diagnostic agent timed out, leaving potential critical database issue undiagnosed
- **Manual intervention required**: Database crash looping requires immediate hands-on investigation due to tool failure

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Operational Runbooks Agent
- Agent execution timed out after 30 seconds. The agent may be stuck on a tool call or LLM response.

## ✅ Investigation Complete

All planned investigation steps have been executed.
