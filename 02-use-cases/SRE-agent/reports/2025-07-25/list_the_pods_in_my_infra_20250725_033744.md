# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) is in CrashLoopBackOff state, indicating repeated failures to start successfully
- **Impact**: Potential database service instability affecting applications that depend on this database
- **Severity**: High - Critical database component failing to run properly while other services remain operational

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Investigate database pod logs to determine crash cause (`kubectl logs database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q`)
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Resolve database pod issues and verify dependent services are functioning properly
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement monitoring alerts for pod status and implement database redundancy if not present
4. **Follow-up**: Review web-app-deployment pod resource utilization (85% memory usage) to prevent potential memory pressure

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Database pod continuously crashing on node-2, potentially affecting application data access and persistence

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- ## Pods in Production Namespace

Based on the results from the `get_pod_status` tool, here are the pods in your production namespace:

| Pod Name | Status | Node | Created At | CPU Usage | Memory Usage |
|----------|--------|------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p | Running | node-1 | 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z | 250m (75%) | 512Mi (85%) |
| database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q | CrashLoopBackOff | node-2 | 2024-01-15T09:15:00Z | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) |
| api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r | Running | node-3 | 2024-01-15T08:00:00Z | 150m (45%) | 256Mi (60%) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-h4k3m | Running | node-1 | 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z | 100m (25%) | 256Mi (40%) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-m8n2p | Running | node-2 | 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z | 95m (24%) | 248Mi (39%) |

**Note:** I've checked the 'production' namespace. If you'd like to see pods in a different namespace, please let me know which namespace you're interested in.

**Warning:** According to the `get_pod_status` tool output, there's an issue with the `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q` pod which is in a CrashLoopBackOff state. You may want to investigate this further.

## 📋 Next Steps

3. Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent will examine node status to verify infrastructure health using get_node_status tool
