# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** what is the status of my database pod
**Status:** Step 3 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Missing configuration file `config/database.conf` in ConfigMap `production/database-config` preventing database pod initialization
- **Impact**: Service outage - Database pod completely unable to start and run
- **Severity**: **Critical** - Core database service is non-functional, blocking dependent applications

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Verify existence of ConfigMap `production/database-config` and restore missing `config/database.conf` key
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Investigate if ConfigMap was accidentally deleted or modified; recreate with proper database configuration
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement ConfigMap backup/versioning and monitoring to prevent configuration loss
4. **Follow-up**: Review PreStopHook failures (12 occurrences) for PostgreSQL shutdown process improvements

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- **Database pod startup failure**: 15 consecutive failures due to missing configuration - immediate restoration required to restore service
- **Cascading impact risk**: Database outage will affect all dependent applications and services

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- Based on get_cluster_events tool data, I can see the root cause of your database pod issues:

**Root Cause Analysis:**
According to get_cluster_events output, the database pod is failing due to:

1. **Missing Configuration:** "Error: couldn't find key config/database.conf in ConfigMap production/database-config" (occurred 15 times)
2. **PreStopHook Failures:** PostgreSQL shutdown command failing with exit status 1 (occurred 12 times)

**Immediate Action Required:**
The database pod cannot start because it's missing the required configuration file `config/database.conf` in the ConfigMap `production/database-config`. This is preventing the database from initializing properly.

**Recommendations:**
1. Verify the ConfigMap `production/database-config` exists and contains the required `config/database.conf` key
2. Check if the ConfigMap was accidentally deleted or modified
3. Restore the missing configuration or recreate the ConfigMap with the proper database configuration

If you need me to check a different namespace or if you'd like me to investigate the ConfigMap issue further, please let me know. You can also specify a different namespace if your database pod is located elsewhere.

### Application Logs Agent
- I understand you're asking about your database pod status, but as the Application Logs Agent, I specialize in application log analysis and searching rather than Kubernetes pod status monitoring.

For checking the status of your database pod, you would need to consult the **Kubernetes Agent** who has access to pod status, cluster events, and container health information.

However, I can help you investigate any **application logs** related to your database issues! If you're experiencing database problems, I can:

- Search for database-related error logs
- Analyze database connection failures in application logs  
- Look for recent database errors across your services
- Identify patterns in database-related log entries

Would you like me to search for any database-related errors or issues in your application logs instead? For example, I could look for:
- Database connection timeouts
- SQL errors
- Database authentication failures
- Performance issues logged by your applications

Just let me know what specific database-related log analysis you'd like me to perform!

## ✅ Investigation Complete
