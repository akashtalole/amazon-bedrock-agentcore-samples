# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** Our database pods are crash looping in production
**Status:** Investigation Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Investigation incomplete - operational runbooks analysis timed out after 30 seconds
- **Impact**: Unable to assess impact due to incomplete investigation
- **Severity**: **Unknown** - requires immediate manual investigation to determine actual system state

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Manually verify database pod status using `kubectl get pods` and check pod logs to confirm crash looping behavior
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Investigate root cause of database pod failures (resource limits, configuration issues, storage problems)
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Review monitoring and alerting to ensure faster detection of pod failures
4. **Follow-up**: Investigate why operational runbooks agent timed out to prevent future investigation delays

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- **Investigation system failure**: Automated analysis tools are not functioning properly, requiring immediate manual intervention to assess production database status
- **Potential service risk**: Database pod crash looping (if confirmed) could lead to data unavailability

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Operational Runbooks Agent
- Agent execution timed out after 30 seconds. The agent may be stuck on a tool call or LLM response.

## ✅ Investigation Complete

All planned investigation steps have been executed.
