# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** Our database pods are crash looping in production
**Status:** Investigation Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Investigation system failure - all monitoring agents experienced technical failures preventing diagnosis of reported database pod crash loops
- **Impact**: **Investigation blocked** - Unable to determine actual service status or impact due to agent execution failures
- **Severity**: **High** - Critical production database issue remains undiagnosed with investigation tools non-functional

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Manually investigate database pod status using direct kubectl commands (`kubectl get pods -n production`, `kubectl describe pods`, `kubectl logs`)
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Resolve investigation agent tool integration issues to restore monitoring capabilities
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement backup investigation procedures and validate agent reliability
4. **Follow-up**: Test all monitoring agents before next incident to ensure operational readiness

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- **Investigation capability compromised**: All three monitoring agents failed, leaving production database issues undiagnosed
- **Manual intervention required**: Direct Kubernetes cluster access needed to assess actual database pod status and determine if crash loops are ongoing

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- Agent execution timed out after 30 seconds. The agent may be stuck on a tool call or LLM response.

### Application Logs Agent
- Agent execution failed: Found AIMessages with tool_calls that do not have a corresponding ToolMessage. Here are the first few of those tool calls: [{'name': 'k8s-api___get_pod_status', 'args': {'namespace': 'production'}, 'id': 'toolu_bdrk_018HHstrXBe1rie5JGwnm8M7', 'type': 'tool_call'}].

Every tool call (LLM requesting to call a tool) in the message history MUST have a corresponding ToolMessage (result of a tool invocation to return to the LLM) - this is required by most LLM providers.

### Operational Runbooks Agent
