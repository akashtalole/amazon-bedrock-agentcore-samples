# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** Our database pods are crash looping in production
**Status:** Step 3 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Investigation system failure - both monitoring agents experienced technical failures preventing diagnosis
- **Impact**: **Unknown** - Unable to assess actual database pod status due to investigation tool failures
- **Severity**: **High** - Original crash looping report suggests critical database issues, but investigation failure prevents confirmation or resolution

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Manually check database pod status using direct kubectl commands (`kubectl get pods -n production | grep database`)
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Restart investigation tools and re-run analysis once agents are functional
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Review and fix investigation agent reliability to prevent future diagnostic failures
4. **Follow-up**: Implement backup monitoring procedures for when primary investigation tools fail

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- **Investigation Blind Spot**: Current monitoring and diagnostic capabilities are compromised
- **Potential Database Impact**: Original crash looping report remains unverified and unresolved
- **Manual Intervention Required**: Direct system access needed to assess actual production database status

**Note**: This summary reflects investigation tool failures rather than the actual database issue. Immediate manual verification of database pod status is essential.

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- Agent execution timed out after 300 seconds. The agent may be stuck on a tool call or LLM response.

### Application Logs Agent
- Agent execution failed: Found AIMessages with tool_calls that do not have a corresponding ToolMessage. Here are the first few of those tool calls: [{'name': 'k8s-api___get_deployment_status', 'args': {'namespace': 'production', 'deployment_name': 'database-pod'}, 'id': 'toolu_bdrk_01NgwabWB1N4ZPQLmGdb1vcB', 'type': 'tool_call'}].

Every tool call (LLM requesting to call a tool) in the message history MUST have a corresponding ToolMessage (result of a tool invocation to return to the LLM) - this is required by most LLM providers.
