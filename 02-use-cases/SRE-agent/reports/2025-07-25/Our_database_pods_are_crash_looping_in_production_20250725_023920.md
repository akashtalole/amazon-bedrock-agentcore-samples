# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** Our database pods are crash looping in production
**Status:** Investigation Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Unable to determine - all investigation agents failed to complete their analysis
- **Impact**: Unable to verify database pod crash-looping issue due to investigation tool failures
- **Severity**: Medium - Investigation tools are non-functional, preventing proper incident analysis

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Manually verify database pod status using direct kubectl commands to confirm crash-looping behavior
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Troubleshoot and fix the investigation agent failures (timeout and invalid chat history errors)
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement more robust investigation tools with proper error handling
4. **Follow-up**: Review and improve the reliability of the SRE investigation toolchain

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Investigation tools are currently non-functional - all three agents (Kubernetes Infrastructure, Application Logs, and Operational Runbooks) failed to execute properly

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- Agent execution timed out after 120 seconds. The agent may be stuck on a tool call or LLM response.

### Application Logs Agent
- Agent execution failed: Found AIMessages with tool_calls that do not have a corresponding ToolMessage. Here are the first few of those tool calls: [{'name': 'k8s-api___get_cluster_events', 'args': {'severity': 'Warning', 'since': '2024-01-15T00:00:00Z'}, 'id': 'toolu_bdrk_01PzRRDaVMhrLmbsuwPX8z1Y', 'type': 'tool_call'}].

Every tool call (LLM requesting to call a tool) in the message history MUST have a corresponding ToolMessage (result of a tool invocation to return to the LLM) - this is required by most LLM providers.

### Operational Runbooks Agent
- Agent execution failed: Found AIMessages with tool_calls that do not have a corresponding ToolMessage. Here are the first few of those tool calls: [{'name': 'k8s-api___get_cluster_events', 'args': {'severity': 'Warning', 'since': '2024-01-15T00:00:00Z'}, 'id': 'toolu_bdrk_01PzRRDaVMhrLmbsuwPX8z1Y', 'type': 'tool_call'}].
